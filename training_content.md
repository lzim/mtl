# Good to Know

## Add a Link:

Inserting links is easy and you may use them frequently in your documentation. 
I want to learn how to high five. To do that, I need to read [this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_five). 
**Punctuation and spaces matter.**

The syntax to use: 
> [text you want to link](URL of linked content)

## Add an Image: 
Inserting images is easy, and it's helpful to have the code. Remember, **punctuation and spaces matter!** Images must be .png files. To view the syntax to use, look at this .md file in Edit mode.

<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/gh-pages/images/mtl_data_nav.png?raw=true">

GitHub makes numbered lists easy! If you type "1. " (including the space), then type your #1 item, when you press Enter, it will begin the next line with the next number--automatically.

1. This
2. That
3. The other
