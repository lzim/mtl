		exponent greater than 1 indicates that patients are very sensitive to \
		small changes. Example: if a team is putting in 20% more hours per week \
		than their official supply, then an exponent of "1" would indicate that \
		the ratio of missed appointments to all appointments would also be 20% \
		higher than the base case. A value of 0.5 would cause that same 20% \
		increase in hours worked would only cause a 9.5% increase in the missed \
		appointment ratio.  A value of 2 would cause that 20% increase to increase \
		the missed appointment rate by 44% over the base case.

	~	wks
	~	By Little's Law, the average wait time for new patients is the quotient of \
		the number of patients waiting and the rate at which they start service.  \
		If the new patient start rate drops to zero, then the wait is technically \
		infinite, as no patients are leaving the queue. In the model, referrals \

	~	wks
	~	By Little's Law, the average time between appointments for existing \
		patients is the quotient of the number of appointments and the rate at \
		which they are completed.  If there is more demand for completing \
		appointments than there is available capacity, then actual return visit \
		interval will increase, even if the desired RVI doesn't change.  If the \
		completing appointment rate drops to zero, then the wait is technically \
		infinite. In the model, appointments are never cancelled due to high wait \
		times, but for ease of display, Actual RVI is capped at 12 months (52 \
