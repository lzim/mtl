# _MTL_ Live Session 02 

## Today we're *modeling to learn* from patient data and team trends.

Hello! I'm \________________ (facilitator's name) and I'm \_______________ (co-facilitator's name). 
Navigating to the Learner See Guide for Part I at mtl.how, we see that today we're _modeling to learn_ how to check our patient data and team trends.

## Learning Objectives

1. Describe the decisions your team made in producing your team data table.
2. Test whether team historical trends shown in the "viz" tabs reflect your expectations.
3. Apply your clinical expertise to identify new information about a team patient in the "data" tabs.

### Participatory Learning from Simulation

_**Modeling to Learn**_ can help us to get more of our Veterans to the right care in the right time to meet their needs using participatory learning from simulation.

- We use the data user interface (UI) to look back at team trends over the past two years to see what is in our team now.
- A backward looking data review is limited for guiding effective change.
- Even when we see trends that we like, we may not know what is causing those trends. And, we may be afraid that the next change we might make will undo it.
- It is also really demotivating to see trends we don't like, and not know what is causing the problem.
- We will use the sim UI to look at team trends 2 years into the future to answer what if questions about different decisions the team could make. 
- Simulation helps us to place a better initial bet about what is likely to pay off for our local Veteran community in terms of getting patients timely access to our highest quality care.
- What we're doing today is that looking back using the data UI.

## We **zoom in** on a particular **Veteran's care** in the **data** tabs, then we **zoom out** to see what our care decisions are adding up to over time by reviewing **team trends** over the last two years in the **viz** tabs.

**Who would like to "drive" today?** \(Recommend the Team Lead\)

### 1. Open an internet browser window. Go to mtl.how/data 

- We'll be opening the _Modeling to Learn_ data user interface (data UI) in Power BI today. This site contains Protected Health Information (PHI), so ensure you have your PIV card to access the intranet site. As a provider you will be granted access according to the permissions that are set up on your PIV.
- In the left-hand navigation, click one of the four consortia tabs to locate your VISN.
- Click on the "Clinic Selections" tab.

### 2. Select and view your local team data.

#### Think through your Clinic Selection criteria carefully (e.g. Should you include trainees? De-activated clinics? Clinical Resource Hub providers?).
- You can filter by "Division Name", "Physical Location", "Primary Stopcode", "Secondary Stopcode", and/or "Is an Active Clinic?" (de-activated clinics denoted by "ZZ") in the left and middle columns.
- You can search and filter for your team's clinics by clinic name or by provider in the "Select Clinics to Generate Report Data" column after making selections in the left and middle columns.
- Click the yellow "Apply" button to pull Patient Level Data from all clinics selected in the last two years.
- Clinics and data not populating? Request and verify your local server views [described at the bottom of the See guide](https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/master/blue/session02/s02_learner/mtl_session02_see.md#request-and-verify-local-server-view-permissions).

- Select clinics that your team refers to in the **"Team Flow Selection"** tab to produce data tracking patients stepped up/down for the **Team (SP) Flow module.**
  - For example, if you are a GMH team, you would select "SMH" in the dropdown for "The clinics selected below that my team refers to are" and add the SMH clinics your team refers to in the Green column, second row.
  - In the bottom, right hand columns for the three possible care settings (GMH, SMH, PC/PCMHI) indicate the threshold for minimum gap in patient care required for subsequent visit to be considered a new care episode. *In general for the (GMH or SMH or PC/PCMHI) setting, how long of a gap in patient care is required for the subsequent visit to be considered a new care episode? Set the threshold below in months. The default threshold is 9 months (39 weeks).*
  -  Click Apply. 
   
- **Prior to today's session, __________________ \[Team Lead's name\] worked with us to build an initial list of Clinics.**
- **__________________ [Team Lead's name], which column did we find most helpful for creating this team's dataset?**  
- **Are there any adjustments that the team would make to the clinic selection criteria? For example, should we include trainees? Other considerations that seem important?** 

_**Tips & Tricks**_
- To clear filters/columns, click on the "Eraser" icon in the upper right of the filter/column.
- To reset ALL selections across ALL tabs, click the "Reset" button in the upper right hand of the bar.
- To zoom into the screen, hover in the upper right hand corner of the screen until a set of icons appear. 
   - Click on the square "Focus Mode" icon. Click "Back to Report" to return to the previous view. 
       
### 3. **Click to view the "viz" tabs, which show team trends.**

#### _Zoom out_ and see team trends for diagnoses (Diag), encounters (Enc), health factor data (HF; e.g., suicide plans, evidence-based practice templates), measures (Meas), and behavioral and suicide risks (Flag) from Mental Health Assistant. Click on the respective tabs (Diag, Enc, etc) to view these trends. 

- Your team's vision was about _____________. Let's go to the _____________ viz tab to see data relevant to that issue.
- Another way to see encounters or services decreasing or increasing is by viewing the number of visits by right clicking on any trend line and click "Show As Table".
- Filter trends to zoom into a specific team trend by navigating to the right side of the screen and click on the "Funnel" icon to unhide filter panel.
- vizDiag in the data UI shows a trendlines by diagnoses or combination of diagnoses. For example, the "PTSD" line is for patients with only PTSD. The "PTSD & AUD" line is for patients with both these diagnoses but does not discriminate between which is the primary, secondary, etc. diagnoses.

- **What stands out to you about \________________________________**\(fill-in team vision\)?
- **What is most important to you to check out first related to \________________________________**\(fill-in team vision\)? \(Prepare in advance, but ask this as an open-ended question\)?  
- **What is most surprising?** \(Prepare in advance, but ask this as an open-ended question\)
- **What viz option would you use to see what the most common service encounters or visits are?**
- **Are there services that have been increasing over time?**
- **Are there services that have been decreasing over time?** 

_**Tips & Tricks**_
- Right click on any trend line and click "Show As Table" to see encounters or services decrease or increase by viewing the number of visits.
- Filter trends to zoom into a specific team trend by navigating to the right side of the screen and click on the "Funnel" icon to unhide filter panel.
- Note: If you do not see something that you would expect or previously saw, check to see if a filter is applied. 
- Click on the funnel icon in the top upper right. Filters are active if it says "Filters and slicers affecting this visual."

### 4. **Click to view the "data" tabs, which show your team's individual patient information.**

**In the data tabs, we can _zoom in_ on specific veterans. Patient information corresponds to the same categories as the team trends: diagnoses (Diag), encounters (Enc), health factor data (HF; e.g., suicide plans, evidence-based practice templates), measures (Meas), and behavioral and suicide risks (Flag) from Mental Health Assistant.**

We can filter to find specific patients, or produce reports by navigating to the right side of the screen and clicking on the "Funnel" icon to unhide filter panel.
  - **What data tab would you use to find out how many current patients on the team are engaged in a specific evidence-based psychotherapy?**
  - **What column shows you the session number (EBP template) that the patient is on?**

   \(During intersession prep, facilitator should fill-in the rankings of the highest priority viz that should be emphasized during the team meeting. Follow the team's lead "live" during the meeting, but be prepared.\)

   Time Stamp | Team Learning Priorities | Script
   -- | -- | --
   **Prioritize which questions you will use given this team's guiding vision.** |  |  |
   [<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/>](#DontLink) Keep an eye on    time | **Themes from the team vision to be highlighted.** | **Team Data related questions to Prioritize with the Team.**
   |  |  |

_**Tips & Tricks**_
  - dataDiag in the data UI has an additional column after "Diagnoses of Interest," called "Primary Diagnoses", specifying which diagnosis is primary to help providers better understand the characteristics of the patient population.
  - Patients who have requested restricted access to their information have asterisks (******) in the "Patient Name" column. If you are a VA provider, you can still identify patients from the "Patient SSN" Column, or "Patient Name" Column.
  - If you do not see something that you would expect or previously saw, check to see if a filter is applied.
      - Click on the funnel icon in the top upper right. Filters are active if it says "Filters and slicers affecting this visual."

## With the team trends (viz) and team patient (data) information in the data UI, your team can efficiently use team meetings to focus on the interrelated issues of care coordination and team quality improvement.

That's it for *Modeling to Learn* how to check our patient data and team trends. Next is our Done/Do review.
