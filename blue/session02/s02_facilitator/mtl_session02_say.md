## Learning Objectives

1. Describe the decisions your team made in producing your team data table.
2. Test whether team historical trends shown in the "viz" tabs reflect your expectations.
3. Apply your clinical expertise to identify new information about a team patient in the "data" tabs.

### Participatory Learning from Simulation

This graphic illustrates how **_Modeling to Learn_** can help us to get more of our Veterans to the right care in the right time to meet their needs using participatory learning from simulation.

- We use the data user interface (UI) to look back at team trends over the past two years to see *what is* in our team now.
- A backward looking data review is limited for guiding effective change.
- Even when we see trends that we like, we may not know what is causing those trends. And, we may be afraid that the next change we might make will undo it.
- It is also really demotivating to see trends we don't like, and not know what is causing the problem.
- We will use the sim UI to look at team trends 2 years into the future to answer *what if* questions about different decisions the team could make. Simulation helps us to place a better initial bet about what is likely to pay off for our local Veteran community in terms of getting patients timely access to our highest quality care.
- What we're doing today is that *looking back* using the data UI.
- We **zoom in** on a particular **Veteran's care** in the **data** tabs, then we **zoom out** to see what our care decisions are adding up to over time by reviewing **team trends** over the last two years in the **viz** tabs.

**Who would like to "drive" today?** \(Recommend the Team Lead\)

### 1. Open an internet browser window. Go to mtl.how/data_test 

- This will take you to the MTL data user interface Power BI site. This site contains Protected Health Information (PHI), so ensure you have your PIV card to access the intranet site. As a provider you will be granted access according to the permissions that are set up on your PIV.
    - **Note:** If you are getting a red row-level security (RLS) error on the homepage, please let us know and we can grant you access. (_For instructions on how to grant users access, see [Facilitator One-Pager](https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/master/blue/session02/s02_facilitator/mtl_how_data_2.5_facilitator_one_pager.pdf)_).
- We'll be opening the _Modeling to Learn_ data user interface (UI) in Power BI here today.
- We'll show you how data you pull from here will be saved back to this secure site, so that you can protect patient PHI just as you do in all your work. 
- On the landing page, you will select the "Data UI (Viz)" Panel and then the "Clinic Selections" panel. 

## To make selections & view data for your Team, go through Steps #2-4. 

### 2. Selecting & Viewing your Team Data. 

- Select your clinics using the columns to make up your localized team-level data.
- You can search and filter for Clinics by Provider after making selections in Division Name, Physical Location, Primary Stopcode, Secondary Stopcode, and/or Is an Active Clinic columns.
- Click the yellow "Apply" button. 
- Clicking "Apply" in the "Select Clinics to Generate Report Data" column pulls Patient Level Data from all clinics selected, in the last two years.

   - *Note:* Leaving the "Is an Active Clinic" column blank will pull all de-activated clinics used in the last two years (denoted by a "ZZ" prefix). If you do not want inactive clinics to be pulled, under the "Is an Active Clinic" column, check "No" and click the yellow "Apply" button.
   - *Note*: The filters in the light blue and dark blue columns *only* apply to the green Clinics column. You MUST make selections and click "Apply" in the "Select Clinics to Generate Report Data" column to generate your data. (By default, the data and viz tabs is to show all the data for all sta3ns and clinics.)

- **Prior to today's session, __________________ \[Team Lead's name\] worked with us to build an initial team dataset.**
- **__________________ [Team Lead's name], which column did we find most helpful for creating this team's dataset?**  
- **Are there any adjustments that the team would make to the clinic selection criteria? For example, should we include trainees? Other considerations that seem important?** 

**Tips & Tricks**
- To clear filters/columns, click on the "Eraser" icon in the upper right of the filter/column.
- To reset ALL selections across ALL tabs, click the "Reset" button in the upper right hand of the bar.
- To zoom into the screen, hover in the upper right hand corner of the screen until a set of icons appear. Click on the square "Focus Mode" icon. Click "Back to Report" to return to the previous view. 

**New in _MTL_ 2.5** 
- We are now able to support Clinical Resource Hub providers in the Data UI to create a more accurate and localized set of clinics. 
-  _MTL_ 2.5 now has 5 Data Tabs and 5 Viz Tabs to help zoom in or zoom out of a patient or team trend:
   - Health Factors \(HF\)
   - Diagnoses \(Diag\)
   - Encounters \(Enc\),
   - Measurement Based Stepped Care and Suicide Prevention \(Meas\) and
   - (New!) Suicide and Behavior Risk Flags \(Flag\) - We've added this so staff can pay close attention to behavioral and suicide risk.

- **To query patient and clinic level data using the data_ui, you will need LSV permissions.** To check which facilities you have LSV access for, click the [link](https://vaww.pbi.cdw.va.gov/PBIRS/Pages/ReportViewer.aspx?/GPE/PBM_AD/SSRS/LSVAccessVerification) to access the document through VA intranet.
   - Clinical Resource Hub Providers are granted to multiple local server access.

- **If you don't have access to facilities that you believe you should, please verify:**
   1. CPRS access/permissions at your station (i.e COR tab access for CPRS).
   2. Your network username recorded in VistA. To have your network username recording in VistA, please follow the instructions outlined in the [linked document](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/sites/oitbislstaff/FieldOpsAndDataServices/fr/SitePages/CPRS_NetworkUserName.aspx) through VA intranet.
       
### 3. **Click to view the "viz" tabs, which show team trends.**
- The Viz tab helps us _zoom out_ and see team trends for diagnoses, encounters, health factor data (e.g., suicide plans, evidence-based practice templates), measures, and flags from mental health assistant.  
- Your team's vision was about _____________. Let's go to the _____________ viz tab to see data relevant to that issue.
- Another way to see encounters or services decreasing or increasing is by viewing the number of visits by right clicking on any trend line and click "Show As Table".
- Filter trends to zoom into a specific team trend by navigating to the right side of the screen and click on the "Funnel" icon to unhide filter panel.
    - **Tip:** If you do not see something that you would expect or previously saw, check to see if a filter is applied. Click on the **funnel icon** in the top upper right. Filters are active if it says "Filters and slicers affecting this visual".
- vizDiag in the data UI shows a trendlines by diagnoses or combination of diagnoses. For example, the "PTSD" line is for patients with only PTSD. The "PTSD & AUD" line is for patients with both these diagnoses but does not discriminate between which is the primary, secondary, etc. diagnoses.

   - **What is most important to you to check out first related to \________________________________**\(fill-in team vision\)?
    \(Prepare in advance, but ask this as an open-ended question\)?  
   - **What is most surprising?** \(Prepare in advance, but ask this as an open-ended question\)?

**Tips & Tricks**
- To enter "Drill Up" view, right click a trend line and click "Drill Up." The "Drill Up" View shows a zoomed-out view of your team trends.
- However, please note that the shoulders in monthly and yearly views are not meaningful since we do not have all days of observation in a month, or 12 months of   observation in each year, respectively for all of the months and years. 
- To return to previous view, click on the forked downward arrow icon: 
        ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89947989/144062424-23b12423-8b8d-4972-82b0-3d5ebcbcb014.png)

### 4. **Click to view the "data" tabs, which show your team's individual patient information.**
- In the data tabs, we can _zoom in_ on specific veterans. Patient information corresponds to the same categories as the team trends: diagnoses, encounters, health factor data (e.g., suicide plans, evidence-based practice templates), and measures from Mental Health Assistant.
- We can filter to find specific patients or produce reports by navigating to the right side of the screen and clicking on the "Funnel" icon to unhide the filter panel.

**Tips & Tricks**
 - If you do not see something that you would expect or previously saw, check to see if a filter is applied by clicking on the **funnel icon** in the top upper right. Filters are active if it says "Filters and slicers affecting this visual".
   - dataDiag in the data UI has an additional column after "Diagnoses of Interest," called "Primary Diagnoses". "Diagnoses of Interest" retains all the current unordered diagnoses combinations, while "Primary Diagnoses" indicates what is the primary diagnosis. This means that if there is only one diagnosis in the "Diagnoses of Interest" column, it will still repeat what that diagnosis is in the "Primary Diagnoses" column.
 - Patients who have requested restricted access to their information have asterisks (******) in the "Patient Name" column. If you are a VA provider, you can still identify patients from the "Patient SSN" Column, or "Patient Name" Column.

   |  |  |

   - What **data** tab would you use to find out how many current patients on the team are engaged in a specific evidence-based psychotherapy? What column shows you the (EBP Template) session number that the patient is on.
   - What **viz** tab would you use to see what the most common service encounters or visits are?
   - Are there services that have been **increasing over time?**
   - Are there services that have been **decreasing over time?**
   - With the team trends (viz) and team patient (data) information in the data UI, your team can efficiently use team meetings to focus on the interrelated issues of care coordination and team quality improvement.

**That's it for *Modeling to Learn* how to check our patient data and team trends. Next is our Done/Do review.**
