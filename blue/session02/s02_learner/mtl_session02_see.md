# MTL Live Session 02

## Today we're modeling to learn how to check our patient data and team trends.

## Learning Objectives

1. Describe the decisions your team made in producing your team data table.

2. Test whether team historical trends shown in the "viz" tabs reflect your expectations.

3. Apply your clinical expertise to identify new information about a team patient in the "data" tabs.

## In-session Exercise (30 minutes)

We **zoom in** on a particular **Veteran's care** in the **data** tabs, then we can **zoom out** see what our care decisions are adding up to over time by reviewing **team trends** over the last two years in the **viz** tabs.

## *MTL* Data UI

### 1. Open an internet browser window. Go to mtl.how/data. 
- Select the "Data UI (Viz)" Panel and then the "Clinic Selections" panel. 

[![](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/gifs/mtl_2.5/data_ui_home_page_clinic_selection.gif?raw=true)](#DontLink)

## To make selections & view data for your Team, go through Steps #2-4. 

### 2. Selecting & Viewing your Team Data

- Use the columns to select the clinics that make up your team.
- You can search and filter for Clinics by Provider after making selections in Division Name, Physical Location, Primary Stopcode, Secondary Stopcode, and/or Is an Active Clinic column.
- Click the yellow "Apply" button. 
- Clicking "Apply" in the "Select Clinics to Generate Report Data" column pulls Patient Level Data from all clinics selected, in the last two years.

  - Note: Leaving the "Is an Active Clinic" column blank will pull all de-activated clinics used in the last two years (denoted by a "ZZ" prefix). If you do not wish for inactive clinics to be pulled, under the "Is an Active Clinic" column, check "No" and click the yellow "Apply" button. 
  - Note: The filters in the light blue and dark blue columns *only* apply to the green Clinics column. You MUST make selections and click "Apply" in the "Select Clinics to Generate Report Data" column to generate your data. (By default, the data and viz tabs are set to show all data for all sta3ns and clinics.)

**_MTL_ 2.5.**
**For _MTL_ 2.0, click [here](https://github.com/lijenn/mtl/blob/master/blue/session02/s02_learner/mtl_session02_see.md)**


**Tips & Tricks**
- To clear filters/columns, click on the "Eraser" icon in the upper right of the filter/column.
- To reset ALL selections across ALL tabs, click the "Reset" button in the upper right hand of the bar.
- To zoom into the screen, hover in the upper right hand corner of the screen until a set of icons appear. Click on the square "Focus Mode" icon. Click "Back to Report" to return to the previous view.

**New in _MTL_ 2.5** 
- We are now able to support Clinical Resource Hub providers in the Data UI to create a more accurate and localized set of clinics. 
-  _MTL_ 2.5 now has 5 Data Tabs and 5 Viz Tabs to help zoom in or zoom out of a patient or team trend:
   - Health Factors \(HF\)
   - Diagnoses \(Diag\)
   - Encounters \(Enc\),
   - Measurement Based Stepped Care and Suicide Prevention\(SP\) and
   - (New!) Suicide and Behavior Risk Flags \(Flag\) - We've added this so staff can pay close attention to behavioral and suicide risk.

- **To query patient and clinic level data using the data_ui, you will need LSV permissions.** To check which facilities you have LSV access for, click the [link](https://vaww.pbi.cdw.va.gov/PBIRS/Pages/ReportViewer.aspx?/GPE/PBM_AD/SSRS/LSVAccessVerification) to access the document through VA intranet.
   - Clinical Resource Hub Providers are granted to multiple local server access.

- **If you don't have access to facilities that you believe you should, please verify:**
   1. CPRS access/permissions at your station (i.e COR tab access for CPRS).
   2. Your network username recorded in VistA. To have your network username recording in VistA, please follow the instructions outlined in the [linked document](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/sites/oitbislstaff/FieldOpsAndDataServices/fr/SitePages/CPRS_NetworkUserName.aspx) through VA intranet.

### 3. Click to view the "viz" tab, which show team trends.

- The Viz tab helps providers _zoom out_ and see team trends for diagnoses, encounters, health factor data (e.g., suicide plans, evidence-based practice templates), and measures from Mental Health Assistant.
- Another way to see encounters or services decreasing or increasing is by viewing the number of visits by right clicking on any trend line and click "Show As Table".
- Filter trends and zoom into a specific team trend by navigating to the right side of the screen and click on the "Funnel" icon to unhide filter panel.
     - **Note:** If you do not see something that you would expect or previously saw, check to see if a filter is applied.
     - Click on the **funnel icon** in the top upper right. Filters are active if it says "Filters and slicers affecting this visual".

- What stands out to you?
- What is most important to you to check out first?
- What is most surprising?


**Tips & Tricks**
- To enter "Drill Up" view, right click a trend line and click "Drill Up." The "Drill Up" View shows a zoomed-out view of your team trends.
- However, please note that the shoulders in monthly and yearly views are not meaningful since we do not have all days of observation in a month, or 12 months of   observation in each year, respectively for all of the months and years. 
- To return to previous view, click on the forked downward arrow icon:

### 4. Click to view the "data" tab, which show your team's individual patient information.
 - In the data tabs, provderis can _zoom in_ on specific veterans. Patient information corresponds to the same categories as the team trends: diagnoses, encounters, health factor data (e.g., suicide plans, evidence-based practice templates), and measures from Mental Health Assistant.
 - Providers can filter to find specific patients, or produce reports by navigating to the right side of the screen and clicking on the "Funnel" icon to unhide filter panel.

**Tips & Tricks**
 - If you do not see something that you would expect or previously saw, check to see if a filter is applied by clicking on the **funnel icon** in the top upper right. Filters are active if it says "Filters and slicers affecting this visual".
 - dataDiag in the data UI has an additional column after "Diagnoses of Interest," called "Primary Diagnoses", specifying which diagnosis is primary to help providers better understand the characteristics of the patient population.
 - Patients who have requested restricted access to their information have asterisks (******) in the "Patient Name" column. If you are a VA provider, you can still identify patients from the "Patient SSN" Column, or "Patient Name" Column.

- What **data** tab would you use to find out how many current patients on the team are engaged in a specific evidence-based psychotherapy? What column shows you the session number (EBP template) that the patient is on?
- What **viz** option would you use to see what the most common service encounters or visits are?
- Are there services that have been increasing over time? 
- Are there services that have been decreasing over time?

**With the team trends (viz) and team patient (data) information in the data UI, your team can efficiently use team meetings to focus on the interrelated issues of care coordination and team quality improvement.**
