## Learning Objectives

1. Describe the decisions your team made in producing your team data table.

2. Test whether team historical trends shown in the "viz" tabs reflect your expectations.

3. Apply your clinical expertise to identify new information about a team patient in the "data" tabs.

## In-session Exercise (30 minutes)

## *MTL* Data UI

### 1. Open an internet browser window. Go to mtl.how/data. You should see the Power BI Landing page.
- Select the "Data UI (Viz)" Panel and then the "Clinic Selections" panel. 

[![](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/gifs/mtl_2.5/data_ui_home_page_clinic_selection.gif?raw=true)](#DontLink)

## To make selections & view data for your Team, go through Steps #2-4. We will show you the steps but your Team's Clinics have been bookmarked for today's session.

### 2. Selecting & Viewing your Team Data

- We have your Team's Clinic Selections pre-bookmarked for convenience, so you don't have to manually select them now. 
- To navigate to the bookmarks, click on the bookmark icon in the upper right hand in the top of the grey header. 
- Click "Show more bookmarks" and under "Report bookmarks", select the bookmark with your team's name.

- Use the columns to select the clinics that make up your team.
- You can search and filter for Clinics by Provider after making selections in Division Name, Physical Location, Primary Stopcode, Secondary Stopcode, and/or Is Inactive column.
  - Note: Leaving the "Is Inactive" column blank will pull all de-activated clinics used in the last two years (denoted by a "ZZ" prefix). If you do not wish for inactive clinics to be pulled, under the "Is Inactive" column, check "No" and click the yellow "Apply" button. 
- After making all your selections in a column, click the yellow "Apply" button. 
- Clicking "Apply" in the "Select Clinics to Generate Report Data" column pulls Patient Level Data from all clinics selected, in the last two years.
  - Note: The filters in the light blue and dark blue columns *only* apply to the green Clinics column. You MUST make selections and click "Apply" in the "Select Clinics to Generate Report Data" column to generate your data. (By default, the data and viz tabs are set to show all data for all sta3ns and clinics.)

**For _MTL_ 2.0, click [here](https://github.com/lijenn/mtl/blob/master/blue/session02/s02_learner/mtl_session02_see.md)**

**Tips & Tricks**
- To clear filters/columns, click on the "Eraser" icon in the upper right of the filter/column.

**New in _MTL_ 2.5** 
- We are now able to support Clinical Resource Hub providers in the Data UI to create a more accurate and localized set of clinics. 
-  _MTL_ 2.5 now has 5 Data Tabs and 5 Viz Tabs to help zoom in or zoom out of a patient or team trend:
   - Health Factors \(HF\)
   - Diagnoses \(Diag\)
   - Encounters \(Enc\),
   - Measurement Based Stepped Care and Suicide Prevention\(SP\) and
   - (New!) Suicide and Behavior Risk Flags \(Flag\) - We've added this so staff can pay close attention to behavioral and suicide risk.

- **To query patient and clinic level data using the data_ui, you will need LSV permissions.** To check which facilities you have LSV access for, click the [link](https://vaww.pbi.cdw.va.gov/PBIRS/Pages/ReportViewer.aspx?/GPE/PBM_AD/SSRS/LSVAccessVerification) to access the document through VA intranet.
   - Clinical Resource Hub Providers are granted to multiple local server access.

- **If you don't have access to facilities that you believe you should, please verify:**
   1. CPRS access/permissions at your station (i.e COR tab access for CPRS).
   2. Your network username recorded in VistA. To have your network username recording in VistA, please follow the instructions outlined in the [linked document](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/sites/oitbislstaff/FieldOpsAndDataServices/fr/SitePages/CPRS_NetworkUserName.aspx) through VA intranet.

### 3. Click to view the "viz" tab, which show team trends.

- The Viz tab shows team trends for diagnoses, encounters, health factor data (e.g., suicide plans, evidence-based practice templates), and measures from Mental Health Assistant.
- You can explore further Counts in the "viz" tabs by right clicking on any trend line and "Show As Table" to view the number of visits in a trend (The "Quick Explore" feature is no longer available.)
- Filter trends to zoom into a specific team trend by navigating to the right side of the screen and click on the "Funnel" icon to unhide filter panel.
     - **Note:** If you do not see something that you would expect or previously saw, check to see if a filter is applied.
     - Click on the **funnel icon** in the top upper right. Filters are active if it says "Filters and slicers affecting this visual".

- What stands out to you?
- What is most important to you to check out first?
- What is most surprising?

**Tips & Tricks**
- To enter "Drill Up" view, right click a trend line and click "Drill Up." The "Drill Up" View shows a zoomed-out view of your team trends.
- However, please note that the shoulders in monthly and yearly views are not meaningful since we do not have all days of observation in a month, or 12 months of   observation in each year, respectively for all of the months and years. 
- To return to previous view, click on the forked downward arrow icon: 
        ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89947989/144062424-23b12423-8b8d-4972-82b0-3d5ebcbcb014.png)

### 4. Click to view the "data" tab, which show your team's individual patient information.

 - Patients who have requested restricted access to their information have asterisks (******) in the "Patient Name" column. If you are a VA provider, you can still identify patients from the "Patient SSN" Column, or "Patient Name" Column.
- Patient information corresponds to the same categories as the team trends: diagnoses, encounters, health factor data (e.g., suicide plans, evidence-based practice templates), and measures from Mental Health Assistant.
 - dataDiag in the data UI has an additional column after "Diagnoses of Interest," called "Primary Diagnoses", specifying which diagnosis is primary.
 - Providers can filter to find specific patients, or produce reports by navigating to the right side of the screen and click on the "Funnel" icon to unhide filter panel.
     - **Note:** If you do not see something that you would expect or previously saw, check to see if a filter is applied.
     - Click on the **funnel icon** in the top upper right. Filters are active if it says "Filters and slicers affecting this visual".

- What **data** tab would you use to find out how many current patients on the team are engaged in a specific evidence-based psychotherapy? What column shows you the session number (EBP template) that the patient is on?
- What **viz** option would you use to see what the most common service encounters or visits are?
- Are there services that have been increasing over time? 
- Are there services that have been decreasing over time?

**With the team trends (viz) and team patient (data) information in the data UI, your team can efficiently use team meetings to focus on the interrelated issues of care coordination and team quality improvement.**
