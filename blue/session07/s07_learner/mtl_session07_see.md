# MTL Live Session 07

# Today we're modeling to learn how to evaluate our Base Case of no new decisions.

## Learning Objectives

1. Describe the base case of no new decisions in your team.
2. Test out your thinking about what is likely to cause oscillation in team trends.
3. Apply systems thinking to develop a hypothesis about your team's clinical priority.

# In-session Exercise (30 minutes)

[<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/illustrations/data_ui_sim_ui.png">](#.)

### 1. Log in to your team world at mtl.how/sim.  
   - Click *Join Current Session* to pick up where the team left off.  
   - Orient yourself to the main page: 
     - Team Name (when you're in your individual world, the team name is your name)
     - Selected module (CC, MM, PSY, AGG, or SP)
     - Selected Team Data 
     - All slider settings in the Experiments section are at Base Case or default values

[<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_question.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/>](#.) **Our Question.** *Briefly describe what your team wants to learn from this experiment.*  

[<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_hypothesis.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/>](#.) **Our Hypothesis.** *Outline the systems story your team believes will cause the outcomes your team expects to observe.*  

  **_MTL_ 3.0. For _MTL_ 2.0, click [here](https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/master/release_2.0/mtl_session07_see.md).**  

### 2. Run a base case.
  - Expand the Outputs and Text section.
  - **Enter text in the boxes to reflect your question and hypothesis about a base case run – one where no new changes are made in your team.**
  - **Click "Run," running the simulation out to its 2-year end using data pulled in from your team data file.**  
  - Save (without resetting) the run with the name "Base Case."

### 3. Review the Current Experiment Values in the Control Panel.
   - **You should see all variables at Base Case or default values.**  
   - **Orient yourself to the charts in the Results Dashboard (axes, units, legend, drop-down menu options).**  

### 4. Describe what you see in the Our Findings box. 

- **What do you notice about the results? Do they match your hypothesis?** 
- **Compare the values in the charts with the Team Data Table numbers.**
- **Record your Findings - what you learned from the Results compared to your Hypothesis.**

  [<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_findings.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/>](#.) **Our Findings.** *Describe your team's findings, insights and conclusions from this experiment.*  
  
  [<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_decisions.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/>](#.) **Our Decisions.** *Based on what you learned in this experiment, what changes are you ready to make in your practice?*  
  
### 5. Make and record your Team Decisions.
  - **What do these findings suggest doing differently in your team?**
  - **What did the team decide to investigate next?** 
  - **Save and Reset when ready.** 
  - ***Notice that the sim UI automatically adds the date to the name of the run for you.***
