## Learning Objectives

1. Describe the decisions you experimented with and how they are intertwined with other decisions and clinic outcomes over time. 

2. Test your understanding of the causal system story by describing what’s happening when it produces a system behavior over time. 

3. Apply your thinking to anticipate the short and long term trends in your team’s care quality under different decision scenarios. 


# In-session Exercise (30 minutes)

**We've been _Modeling to Learn_ how to improve our use of systems thinking when making care decisions in our team.**

Systems Thinking | Definition
-- | -- 
Complex | **Forest   not trees.**    Relationships among two or more   variables (wait times, improvement rate), or two or more settings (primary   care, general mental health).
Feedback | **Loop not line.**    Not simple cause and effect. The end of   the story often influences the beginning, and is strengthened (reinforcing)   or reduced (balancing) around the loop.
System Behavior | **Movie   not snapshot.**    Trends over time.    Systems cause their own behavior   through feedback.
Time | **Short   and   long term.**      Better understanding of change over   time   (e.g., worse before better, better   before worse).

**We'll work to apply these skills as we review our combined experiment today.**

1.	Log in to mtl.how/sim and join the current session.

**_MTL_ 2.0. For _MTL_ 1.7, click [here](https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/master/release_1.7/mtl_session09_see.md)**

   - If you logged into your *individual world*, review your saved runs in the Experiment Maintenance section. Rename your saved runs if you feel you need to.

   - If you logged into your *individual world*, review the data files you have uploaded in the Team Data Menu Maintenance section and make sure you have the data file you want.
   
2. From the experiment tile, pull up the prior experiment and click the red "Go" button.

3. Check the box to include the text from that experiment and click "Go" again.

4. Note that the sliders have moved to the settings for that experiment.

5. Open the Expanded Outputs tile and select another earlier experiment to compare to the one you have just pulled up.

6. Note the variables that were manipulated in the two experiments.

7. Review the findings from the two experiments in the results dashboard and the text entered for Hypothesis, Findings and Decisions.

8. Collapse the Expanded Outputs tile and move it to the side to reveal the model diagram.

9. Use the diagram to tell a system story about the differences in the two experiments.

10. Consider running a combination experiment that incorporates the sliders manipulated in both experiments.

11. Replace text in the Q/H/F/D boxes to reflect the team's hypotheses and expectations for the combined experiment.

12. Save, name, and run the combined experiment.

13. Discuss and record results and decisions, including your thinking about long-term trends in your clinic's EBP reach under various decision scenarios.
