## Learning Objectives

1. Describe the team data in the Experiments section. 

2. Test out the simulation user-interface for more information about team data.

3. Apply clinical expertise to consider the decisions the team makes that affect these variables.


# In-session Exercise (30 minutes)

# Session 5 In-Session Exercise
[<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/illustrations/data_ui_sim_ui.png">](#DontLink)

## Check the name of your team data file in Explorer
1. In session 3, we used our team data UI and clicked "Create Team Data Table" to produce our team data for simulation. 
2. Let's now go back to mtl.how/data in an Internet Explorer window to check the name of our team data file.
3. The team data file for simulation is in our team folder, in the team_data_sim folder. 
    + Copy the name of the team data file.

**_MTL_ 2.0. For _MTL_ 1.7, click [here](https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/master/release_1.7/mtl_session05_see.md)**

## Log in to the sim UI in Chrome

4. Log in to the sim UI.

    + Open a new browser window in Google Chrome and go to mtl.how/sim.

    + Enter your login credentials and click the "Login" button.

    + A box instructing you to *Please select a World* will appear. If you are working collaboratively with your team in *MTL* please select your team world denoted by "team" in the title of the world. If you are exploring the Sim UI on your own, please select your individual world denoted by "ind" in the title of the world. Click "Select World."

   + Note: Be aware that this is a responsive web design, meaning that it adjusts the page layout to optimize to your screen's dimensions. For example, if you use your browser control to reduce the window size, the sim UI will adjust to stack these sections vertically instead of showing them side by side. Similarly, if you are logged in on a smartphone or other device, it might look different to you.

**_MTL_ 2.0. For _MTL_ 1.7, click [here](https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/master/release_1.7/mtl_session05_see.md)**

#### New for _MTL_ 2.0
- You can use several browsers outside of Chrome that are not Explorer. As the warning states on the login page of the sim UI "The _Modeling to Learn_ simulation user interface does not work on Explorer. Please use Edge, Firefox, Chrome or Safari via desktop or mobile."

- If you forget your password, click on the red "Reset Password" at the bottom of the login section. An email will be sent to you to create a new password.

- If there is a critical issue that everyone needs to be alerted to, there will be a red "Alert" pop-up upon login, alerting everyone to the issue. These issues are our top priority to resolve. Once you dismiss this alert once, it will not reappear.
