## Learning Objectives

1. Describe the team data in the Experiments section. 

2. Test out the simulation user-interface for more information about team data.

3. Apply clinical expertise to consider the decisions the team makes that affect these variables.

# Session 5 In-Session Exercise

### Log into the sim UI

    - Go to mtl.how/sim
    - Enter your login credentials and click the "Login" button.
    - A box instructing you to *Please select a World* will appear. If you are working collaboratively with your team in *MTL* please select your team world denoted by "team" in the title of the world. If you are exploring the Sim UI on your own, please select your individual world denoted by "ind" in the title of the world. 
    - Click "Select World."

**_MTL_ 3.0. For *MTL* 2.0 click [here](https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/master/release_2.0/mtl_session05_see.md)**

### Orient yourself to the landing page 
- Look at: Team name, navigation icons, player name, welcome text, sections with blue headers.

**Tips & Tricks** [JENN - PLEASE REMOVE WHAT SEEMS EXESSIVE]
- Click on the "Tutor" icons for an "over the shoulder" orientation to the different icons, blue headers, and functions of each page. 
- Click on the "Team" icon to chat with your team or facilitator.
- Click on the "More Info" icon for more information on the sim UI.
- Click on the "News" icon for news flashes on discussion items. 
- Click on the "Report Bug" Icon in the top nav bar to report issues (scroll to the bottom of the page for instructions on reporting a bug).
- Click on the "Community" button on the bottom right if you have an idea, you like something or if you have a question

**_MTL_ 3.0. For _MTL_ 2.0, click [here](https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/master/release_2.0/mtl_session05_see.md)**

### Upload your Team Data file to the Sim UI.
- Open the Team Data Maintenance section and click Add. 
- Find your Team Data file and add it to the collection. 
- The team data file for simulation is in our team folder, in the team_data_sim folder.

### Start a New Session.

   - Select the module your team decided to use. 
   - Select the team data you want to use.
   - Click Play.

   - *For CC & MM, you need to select your Learning Mode before hitting Play.*
       - *Refer to the Care Coordination (CCParams) or Medication Management (MMParams) tab of the Team Data Table at mtl.how/data, for data regarding the team's New Patient Start Rates and Return-to-Clinic Intervals.*
       - ***Note:** Once you pick a Learning Mode to prioritize the New Patient Start Rate or the Existing Patients Return-to-Clinic Visit Interval, this will be the setting your team will experiment with through Session 12 for the rest of the *Modeling to Learn* program.*

### Orient yourself to the Main Page of the sim UI (same information and buttons at top; 4 sections with blue header - one showing the module and team data selected in its header; the others headed Outputs and Text, Experiments, and Text).

#### Tips & Tricks [JENN - PLEASE REMOVE WHAT SEEMS EXESSIVE]
- The "Outputs" section is now called "Outputs and Text."
- To get the "Text" pop-up from the "Outputs and Text" section, click on the "T" icon with the arrow. Click once more on the "Expand" icon in the top right of the "Text" pop-up to get to the expanded view of the "Outputs and Text" section that show the Q/H/F/D text and 6 Output charts in one view.
    - Click on the "Minimize" icon in the top right of the expanded "Outputs and Text" view to return to the "Text" pop-up.
- "Exclamation points" in the Team Data Table for Measurement Based Stepped Care & Suicide Prevention (SP): Sometimes we may have estimates derived from very few observations. We decided to set infrequently observed values to zero to avoid inflation of rarer episodes of care. Poor inferences are possible using estimates when the count is low and the duration is low. If the values are <1% of the total counts of episodes of care in the team, and they are retained in the model, it will inflate rare episodes.
    - Exclamation points in the Team Data Table will indicate when a parameter is too low to be validly used.
    - The relevant red parameter values in the model diagram will have a corresponding exclamation point.
    - You will get a pop-up message from clicking on the exclamation point in either the Team Data Table or the Model Diagram to explain what is happening.

### Expand the Experiments section and read the "i" information for the Team Data Table.
   - Open the section by clicking on the white down arrow in the right corner of the blue bar. 
   - Click on the "i" in the red circle next to Team Data and read the “i” information for the Team Data table.
   - What types of decisions does the team make that affect these variables?
   - How do the values in this table strike you? Do they line up with how you think things really are?

### Find the Team Data Table variables in the system diagram at the left.

   - True Missed Appointments %
   - Appointment Supply
   - Return Visit Interval
   - Engagement Duration	
   - New Patient Start Rate (AGG)
