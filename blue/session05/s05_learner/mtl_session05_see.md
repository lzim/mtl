## Learning Objectives

1. Describe the team data in the Experiments section. 

2. Test out the simulation user-interface for more information about team data.

3. Apply clinical expertise to consider the decisions the team makes that affect these variables.


# In-session Exercise (30 minutes)

## Check the name of your team data file.
1. In session 3, we used our team data UI and clicked "Create Team Data Table" to produce our team data for simulation. 
2. Let's now go back to mtl.how/data in any browser window to check the name of our team data file.
3. The team data file for simulation is in our team folder, in the team_data_sim folder. 
    + Copy the name of the team data file.

**_MTL_ 2.0. For _MTL_ 1.7, click [here](https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/master/release_1.7/mtl_session05_see.md)**

## Log in to the sim UI in Chrome.

4. Log in to the sim UI.

    + Open a new browser window in Google Chrome and go to mtl.how/sim.

    + Enter your login credentials and click the "Login" button.

    + A box instructing you to *Please select a World* will appear. If you are working collaboratively with your team in *MTL* please select your team world denoted by "team" in the title of the world. If you are exploring the Sim UI on your own, please select your individual world denoted by "ind" in the title of the world. Click "Select World."

   + Note: Be aware that this is a responsive web design, meaning that it adjusts the page layout to optimize to your screen's dimensions. For example, if you use your browser control to reduce the window size, the sim UI will adjust to stack these sections vertically instead of showing them side by side. Similarly, if you are logged in on a smartphone or other device, it might look different to you.

#### New for _MTL_ 2.0
- You can use several browsers outside of Chrome that are not Explorer. As the warning states on the login page of the sim UI "The _Modeling to Learn_ simulation user interface does not work on Explorer. Please use Edge, Firefox, Chrome or Safari via desktop or mobile."

- If you forget your password, click on the red "Reset Password" at the bottom of the login section. An email will be sent to you to create a new password.

- If there is a critical issue that everyone needs to be alerted to, there will be a red "Alert" pop-up upon login, alerting everyone to the issue. These issues are our top priority to resolve. Once you dismiss this alert once, it will not reappear. 

For *MTL* 1.7 click [here](https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/master/release_1.7/mtl_session05_see.md).


5. Orient yourself to the landing page (Team name, navigation icons, player name, welcome text, sections with blue headers).

For *MTL* 1.7 click [here](https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/master/release_1.7/mtl_session05_see.md).

6. Start a New Session.

   + Select the module your team decided to use. 

   + Select the team data you want to use.
   
   + Click Play.

#### New for _MTL_ 2.0

   + For CC & MM, you need to select your Learning Mode before hitting Play.  
       + Refer to the Care Coordination (CCParams) or Medication Management (MMParams) tab of the Team Data Table at mtl.how/data, for data regarding the team's New Patient Start Rates and Return-to-Clinic Intervals.
       + **Note:** Once you pick a Learning Mode to prioritize the New Patient Start Rate or the Existing Patients Return-to-Clinic Visit Interval, this will be the setting your team will experiment with through Session 12 for the rest of the *Modeling to Learn* program.
   
[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/gifs/mtl_2.0/learning_mode.gif)](#DontLink)

   + Upon clicking icons like "Play," "Run," or "Reset,' a quick tip will appear on the loading screen on different functions in the sim UI.

For *MTL* 1.7 click [here](https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/master/release_1.7/mtl_session05_see.md).

7. Orient yourself to the Main Page of the sim UI (same information and buttons at top; 4 sections with blue header - one showing the module and team data selected in its header; the others headed Outputs and Text, Experiments, and Text).

#### New for _MTL_ 2.0
- The "Outputs" section is now called "Outputs and Text."
- To get the "Text" pop-up from the "Outputs and Text" section, click on the "T" icon with the arrow. Click once more on the "Expand" icon in the top right of the "Text" pop-up to get to the expanded view of the "Outputs and Text" section that show the Q/H/F/D text and 6 Output charts in one view.
  - Click on the "Minimize" icon in the top right of the expanded "Outputs and Text" view to return to the "Text" pop-up.
- "Exclamation points" in the Team Data Table for Measurement Based Stepped Care & Suicide Prevention (SP): Sometimes we may have estimates derived from very few observations. We decided to set infrequently observed values to zero to avoid inflation of rarer episodes of care. Poor inferences are possible using estimates when the count is low and the duration is low. If the values are <1% of the total counts of episodes of care in the team, and they are retained in the model, it will inflate rare episodes.
  - Exclamation points in the Team Data Table will indicate when a parameter is too low to be validly used.
  - The relevant red parameter values in the model diagram will have a corresponding exclamation point.
  - You will get a pop-up message from clicking on the exclamation point in either the Team Data Table or the Model Diagram to explain what is happening.

8. Expand the Experiments section and read the "i" information for the Team Data Table.
   + Open the section by clicking on the white down arrow in the right corner of the blue bar. 
   
   + Click on the "i" in the red circle next to Team Data and read the “i” information for the Team Data table.

   + What types of decisions does the team make that affect these variables?

   + How do the values in this table strike you? Do they line up with how you think things really are?
   
[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/gifs/mtl_2.0/s5_i_information.gif)](#DontLink)
