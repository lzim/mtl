# MTL Live Session 03

## Today we're modeling to learn how to produce team data for simulation.

## Learning Objectives

1. Describe your team trends over the last two years based on the estimates in the team data.

2. Test your understanding of how the team data are estimated by reviewing descriptions and definitions.

3. Apply your clinical expertise to consider the team trends in the data UI and team data to identify team priorities for learning.

## In-session Exercise (30 minutes)

### When you make Clinic Selections & click the "Apply" button, it produces tabs of descriptive team data.

- Last session, we made ClinicSelections to _zoom in_ on a particular Veteran's care in the data tabs and to _zoom out_ and see what our care decisions are adding up to over time by reviewing team trends over the last two years in the viz tabs.
- In today's session, we will make ClinicSelections to review team data estimates related to common care problems, each stored in their own _Modeling to Learn_ tabs:
  - Care Coordination (CC)
  - Medication Management (MM)
  - Psychotherapy (PSY)
  - Team (AGG) Care
  - Team (SP) Flow: Measurement Based Stepped Care and Suicide Prevention
 
- These **Team Data** are means, medians and percentages of key variables likely to influence the team's priorities for learning from *Modeling to Learn.*

- At[mtl.how/data_test](https://mtl.how/data_test), click on **"Data UI (Team Data)"**. In the Dropdown menu that appears, click on the  **ClinicSelection tab**. 
- Your Team's Clinic Selections from the previous session should auto-populate in the **ClinicSelection** tab. 
- In the event they do not, to make clinic selections yourself, you can select the same set of clinics you chose in Session 2 of _Modeling to Learn_ to review team data estimates to the related common care problems mentioned above. 
- Then, click "Apply".

*Coming Soon!* 
- If you want to produce data for the **SP module**, click on the **SPReferrals tab**. Use this tab to select clinics that your team refers to/receives referrals from for the Measurement Based Stepped Care and Suicide Prevention module. The data pull will track patients stepped up/down between your team and the one(s) you select. For example, if you are a GMH team, you would select "SMH" in the dropdown for "The clinics selected below that my team refers to are" and add the SMH clinics your team refers to in Column A. Once you have selected referral clinics in the **SPReferrals tab**, return to the "ClinicSelection" tab.
  - If you include SP in the module selection, three pop-ups will appear for the three possible care settings (GMH, SMH, PC/PCMHI) to indicate the threshold for minimum gap in patient care required for subsequent visit to be considered a new care episode. *In general for the (GMH or SMH or PC/PCMHI) setting, how long of a gap in patient care is required for the subsequent visit to be considered a new care episode? Set the threshold below in weeks. The default threshold is 39 weeks (9 months).*

### 1. Select a module for review

- Find a variable that is important to your team. How is it estimated in this module? What are its units?
- Where can you find even more detailed information about your team data?
- Check out the "Descriptions" Tab and the "Details" Tab corresponding to this module. What is the difference between the "Descriptions" and "Details" tabs?

### 2. Select a second module for review

- Check out the "Descriptions" Tab and the "Details" Tab corresponding to this module. What is the difference between the "Descriptions" and "Details" tabs?
- Find a variable that is important to your team. How is it estimated in this module? What are its units?
- Where can you find even more detailed information about your team data?

### 3. Are there any team data values you would like to explore in the team data UI?

- If so, which ones? Open the data UI to examine your question.

### 4. Does the team see any values in the team data that seem to vary significantly from expectations?

- If so, what is surprising? Does the estimation definition (text in red) help you to interpret the variable value?

### 5. Does the team see any values in the team data that fit your expectations about high priority team needs?

- If so, what are you noticing? In what ways does the team data fit with your day-to-day clinical practice in your team?
