# Today we're modeling to learn how to produce team data for simulation.  
- [ ] Hello! I'm __________ and I'm __________ [Co-facilitators introduce themselves]. Today we're modeling to learn how to produce team data for simulation.

### Navigate to the SEE guide to show Done/Do table
[<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style = “display:inline-block”/>](#DontClick) ____________ **Time 00:00-00:10 - Done/Do and Learning Objectives**
 
- [ ] [<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/done.png" height = "40" width = "40">](#DontClick) Done: Reviewed the HF, Diag, Enc, SP and Flag tabs in Team Data UI to find a patient (zoom in) and found a team trend (zoom out). 
- [ ] [<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/do.png" height = "40" width = "40">](#DontClick) 
Do: We will examine team data and produce team data for the _MTL_ simulation user-interface (sim UI).  


<!-- Learning Objectives Icon -->

## Learning Objectives for Session 3
1. Describe your team trends over the last two years based on the estimates in the team data.
2. Test out your understanding of how the team data is estimated through review of the descriptions and definitions. 
3. Apply your clinical expertise to consider the team trends in the data UI and team data to identify team priorities for learning.

## Start In-session Exercise
[<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style = “display:inline-block”/>](#DontClick) ____________ **Time 00:10-00:15 – Review Graphic & Navigate to mtl.how/data_test_test**
- [ ] We will use the data UI to look back at team trends over the past two years - *what is*;  
- [ ] We will use the sim UI to look at team trends 2 years into the future to answer *what if* questions about different decisions the team could make.  


<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/illustrations/data_ui_sim_ui.png">


### 1. Navigate to the data UI at mtl.how/data_test_test. Click on "Data UI (Team Data)."
- [ ] Data UI on VA's secure Power BI site; works on any browser.
- [ ] You must have your PIV card engaged and you should have all the same permissions to access the site. 

[<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style = “display:inline-block”/>](#DontClick) ____________ **Time 00:15-00:25 – Review how to “Get Team Data Table"**

### 2. When you make Clinic Selections & click the "Apply" button, it produces tabs of descriptive team data.

- [ ] Data in the "Team Data" tab are means, medians and percentages of key variables likely to influence the team's priorities for learning from *Modeling to Learn*. 
- [ ] In today's session, we will make ClinicSelections to review Team Data estimates related to common care problems, each stored in their own  _Modeling to Learn_ tabs:
   + Care Coordination (CC) - tab title *Care Coordination (CC)*
   + Medication Management (MM) - tab title *Medication Management (MM)*
   + Psychotherapy (PSY) - tab title *Psychotherapy (PSY)*
   + Team (Aggregate) Care - tab title * Team (AGG) Care*
   + *Coming Soon!* Measurement-based stepped care and suicide prevention (SP) - tab title *SPParams*

- The Clinic Selections you made last time should auto-populate in the **ClinicSelection** tab. 
- In the event they do not, to make clinic selections yourself:
  - Select the **same** set of clinics in the **ClinicSelection tab** 
  - Click "Apply."
    
### *Coming Soon* See SAY guide for narration details on generating file for SP module  
 
 [<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style = “display:inline-block”/>](#DontClick) ____________ **Time 00:25-00:35 – Select and review a *MTL* Module**

### 3. Let's select a module for review - to show what data are used to tailor each *MTL* module to your team.  

#### [Choose a module] – *See SAY guide for descriptions of each module*  

- [ ] Check out the different modules that are highlighted in the team data on the screen. As we review, we will use the mouse to highlight key team data variables.  
- [ ] Find a variable important to your team. Look at how it is estimated in the tab and notice the units.  
- [ ] The Team Data tabs have more detailed information about team data.  
- [ ] Review  the "Descriptions" and "Details" tabs below the tab with the numerical data [show with mouse]:  
	- The "Descriptions" Tab [click on Tab] gives the description or definition of the variable.  
	- The "Details" Tab [click on Tab] contains additional details about how individual patient data are extracted and used to calculate your team’s historical trends. 
	
[<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style = “display:inline-block”/>](#DontClick) ____________ **Time 00:35-00:45 – Select and review a second *MTL* Module**  

### 4. Let’s select a second module for review.  
- [ ] Again, check out the"Descriptions" and "Details" tabs below the tab with the numerical data. 
- [ ] Find a variable important to the team. How is it estimated in this tab? What are its units?   
- [ ] Where can you find even more detailed information about your team data? Click on the “DataNotes” tab for a breakdown of how the patient cohort is defined, CPT codes used, and patient engagement patterns (Psychotherapy module).  

[<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style = “display:inline-block”/>](#DontClick) ____________ **Time 00:45-00:50 – Explore team data table values of interest to the team**  

### 5. Are there any team data values you would like to explore in the team data UI?  
### 6. Do you see any team data values that differ a lot from what you would expect?  
### 7. Do you see any team data values that confirm your thoughts about high priority team needs?  
- [ ] What are you noticing? What is surprising?
- [ ] In what ways does the team data fit with your day-to-day experience?  

### That's it for _Modeling to learn_ how to produce team data for simulation. Next is our Done/Do review.

### Navigate to the SEE guide to show Done/Do table  
[<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style = “display:inline-block”/>](#DontClick) ____________ **Time 00:50-01:00 – Done / Do Review**  

 
- [ ] [<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/done.png" height = "40" width = "40">](#DontClick) Done: We produced team data for the _MTL_ simulation user-interface (sim UI).  
- [ ] [<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/do.png" height = "40" width = "40">](#DontClick) Do: Find something in the team data table. Complete the mtl.how/menu to prioritize your needs. Responses are confidential.  
### DO demo
-	Encourage team members to look around in the team data tabs before next time. 
-	Ask team members to fill out form at mtl.how/menu (open on Chrome or Edge for the best experience).
-	The username is yout VA email. It will take about 5 minutes. 
-	Responses will be aggregated and discussed in Session 4 to help choose which *MTL* module we'll use for the next several sessions of *Modeling to Learn*.

## Until next time, thank you for *Modeling to Learn*!
