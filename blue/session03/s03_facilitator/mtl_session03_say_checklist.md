# _MTL_ Live Session 03

# Today we're _modeling to learn_ how to produce team data for simulation.  

- [ ] Hello! I'm __________ and I'm __________ [Co-facilitators introduce themselves]. Today we're _modeling to learn_ how to produce team data for simulation.

### Navigate to the SEE guide to show Done/Do table
[<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style = “display:inline-block”/>](#DontClick) ____________ **Time 00:00-00:10 - Done/Do and Learning Objectives**
 
- [ ] [<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/done.png" height = "40" width = "40">](#DontClick) Done: Reviewed the HF, Diag, Enc, Flag tabs in viz and data tabs to find a patient (zoom in) and found a team trend (zoom out). 
- [ ] [<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/do.png" height = "40" width = "40">](#DontClick) 
Do: We will examine team data and produce team data for the _MTL_ simulation user-interface (sim UI).

## Learning Objectives for Session 3
1. Describe your team trends over the last two years based on the estimates in the team data.
2. Test out your understanding of how the team data is estimated through review of the descriptions and definitions. 
3. Apply your clinical expertise to consider the team trends in the viz and data tabs and team data to identify team priorities for learning.

## Start In-session Exercise
[<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style = “display:inline-block”/>](#DontClick) ____________ **Time 00:10-00:15 – Review Graphic & Navigate to mtl.how/data**
- [ ] We will use the data UI to look back at team trends over the past two years - *what is*;  
- [ ] We will use the sim UI to look at team trends 2 years into the future to answer *what if* questions about different decisions the team could make.  


<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/illustrations/data_ui_sim_ui.png">

### Last session, we made Clinic Selections to _zoom in_ on a particular Veteran's care in the data tabs and to _zoom out_ and see what our care decisions are adding up to over time by reviewing team trends over the last two years in the viz tabs. 

### Today, we use Clinic Selections to review team data estimates related to common care problems.

- [ ] Team Data tabs contain means, medians and percentages of key variables likely to influence the team's priorities for learning from *Modeling to Learn*. 
- [ ] In today's session, we will use Clinic Selections to review Team Data estimates related to common care problems, each stored in their own _Modeling to Learn_ tabs:
   + **Care Coordination (CC)**
   + **Medication Management (MM)**
   + **Psychotherapy (PSY)**
   + **Team (Aggregate) Care**
   + **Team (Suicide Prevention) Flow: Measurement Based Stepped Care and Suicide Prevention**

[<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style = “display:inline-block”/>](#DontClick) ____________ **Time 00:15-00:20 – Review how to “Get Team Data Table"**

## Once we make Clinic Selections and Team Flow Selection and click the "Apply" button, we produce tabs of descriptive team data.

- [ ] At [mtl.how/data](https://mtl.how/data), select your consortium and VISN on the Data UI Landing page. 
- [ ] Click on the "Clinic Selection" and "Team Flow Selection" tab.
- [ ] Your Team's Clinic Selections and Team Flow Selections from the previous session should auto-populate in these tabs.
     - If not, you can select the same set of clinics you chose in Session 02 of _Modeling to Learn_ Blue.
     - Click "Apply". 
 
 [<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style = “display:inline-block”/>](#DontClick) ____________ **Time 00:20-00:30 – Select and review a *MTL* Module**

#### 1. [Choose a module] – *See SAY guide for descriptions of each module*  

- [ ] **Check out the different modules that are highlighted in the team data on the screen. As we review, we will use the mouse to highlight key team data variables.**  
- [ ] **Find a variable important to your team. Look at how it is estimated in the tab and notice the units.**
- [ ] **The "Descriptions" and "Details" tabs have more detailed information about team data.** 
- [ ] **Review  the "Descriptions" and "Details" tabs with the numerical data [show with mouse]:**
	- **The "Descriptions" Tab [click on Tab] gives the description or definition of the variable.**  
	- **The "Details" Tab [click on Tab] contains additional details about how individual patient data are extracted and used to calculate your team’s historical trends.**
	
[<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style = “display:inline-block”/>](#DontClick) ____________ **Time 00:30-00:40 – Select and review a second *MTL* Module**  

### 2. Let’s select a second module for review.  
- [ ] **Check out the "Descriptions" and "Details" tabs with the numerical data.**
- [ ] **Find a variable important to the team. How is it estimated in this tab? What are its units?** 
- [ ] **Where can you find even more detailed information about your team data?** 
- [ ] **Click on the “Data Notes 1” and "Data Notes 2" tab for a breakdown of how the patient cohort is defined, CPT codes used, and patient engagement patterns (for the Psychotherapy module).**

[<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style = “display:inline-block”/>](#DontClick) ____________ **Time 00:40-00:50 – Explore team data table values of interest to the team**  

### 3. Are there any team data values you would like to explore in the viz & data tabs?  
### 4. Do you see any team data values that differ a lot from what you would expect?  
### 5. Do you see any team data values that confirm your thoughts about high priority team needs?  
- [ ] **What are you noticing? What is surprising?**
- [ ] **In what ways does the team data fit with your day-to-day experience?**

### That's it for _Modeling to Learn_ how to produce team data for simulation. Next is our Done/Do review.

### Navigate to the SEE guide to show Done/Do table  
[<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style = “display:inline-block”/>](#DontClick) ____________ **Time 00:50-0:60 – Done / Do Review**  

 
- [ ] [<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/done.png" height = "40" width = "40">](#DontClick) Done: We produced team data for the _MTL_ simulation user-interface (sim UI).  
- [ ] [<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/do.png" height = "40" width = "40">](#DontClick) Do: Complete the [mtl.how/menu](https://mtl.how/menu) to prioritize your needs. Responses are confidential. Find a patient (zoom in) and find a team trend (zoom out) in the team data. Consider its implications for team decisions.
 
### DO demo
- [ ] Ask team members to fill out form at mtl.how/menu (open on Chrome or Edge for the best experience).
- [ ] The username is your VA email. It will take about 5 minutes. 
- [ ] Responses will be aggregated and discussed in Session 4 to help choose which *MTL* module we'll use for the next several sessions of *Modeling to Learn*.
- [ ] Encourage team members to look around in the team data and "Descriptions" and "Details" before next time. 


## Until next time, thank you for *Modeling to Learn*!

## Upload Team Data to Sim UI 

After confirming and reviewing the team data with the team, upload the Team Data Export for Sim UI into the Sim UI in the Facilitator Dashboard in prep of S05.

- [ ] 1. Generate and save the Team Data Export for Sim UI file from the Data UI in the Team PSD Shared Folder > Clinics > in your Team folder.
   - If you do not have a folder with your Team's name, create one by following our standard naming convention, see [Facilitator One-Pager](https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/master/blue/session03/s03_facilitator/mtl_how_3.0_data_facilitator_one_pager.pdf). 
- [ ] 2. Follow the instructions to "Manage Team Data" in the [_MTL_ Manual](https://lzim.github.io/mtl/8-sim-ui-facilitator-dashboard.html#manage-team-data).
