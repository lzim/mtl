		"unofficial" hours to increase the completion rate to mitigate that \
		increase. A value of "zero" implies that the team will not use overtime or \
		overbook appointments for any amount of work pressure. A value of "1" \
		implies that there is a direct relationship between work pressure and the \
		amount of overtime used (e.g., doubling the work pressure will also double \
		the hours worked per week). For the same situation, a value of "0.5" would \

		of "zero" implies that the team will not delay existing patients' care \
		(i.e., extend patients' RVI) for any amount of work pressure. A value of \
		"1" implies that there is a direct relationship between work pressure and \
		RVI (e.g., doubling the work pressure will also double the RVI). For the \
		same situation, a value of "0.5" would only increase the RVI by 41% over \

		between overtime and burnout and quits. A value of "1" implies the \
		assumption that doubling the hours worked over the official hours will \
		eventually cause enough quits to cut the official hours offered in half. \
		For the same situation, a value of "0.5" would eventually reduce the \
		official team hours to 71% of its original value, and a value of 1.5 would \
		reduce the official hours to 35% of the original.

"Sensitivity of Staff Missed Appointments Due to Short-Term Overtime"= GAME (

	~	Dmnl [0,2,0.1]
	~	This controls the magnitude of the effect changes in overtime have on time \
		for non-patient-facing care tasks and missed appointments. A value of \
		"zero" implies that there is no relationship between overtime and missed \
		appointments. A value below 1 indicates that providers are not sensitive \
		to small changes in overtime and non-patient-facing task time; a value \
		greater than 1 indicates that providers are very sensitive to small \
		changes. Example: if a team is putting in 20% more hours per week than \
		their official supply, then an value of "1" would indicate that the ratio \
		of missed appointments to all appointments would also be 20% higher than \
		before. A value of "0.5" would cause that same 20% increase in hours \
		worked to have less of an effect (causing only a 9.5% increase in the \
		missed appointment percentage). A value of "2" would cause that same 20% \
		increase to have a greater effect ( raising the missed appointment \
		percentage by 44%).
