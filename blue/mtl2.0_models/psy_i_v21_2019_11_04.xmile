Estimates from the team's data for Return Visit Interval and Median Engagement Duration during a patients first 3 months in care are modified accordingly.  Also, this more intensive therapy results in more patients completing a timely dose, modifying patient flow percentages estimated from the team's data (specifically: the gap between the desired and current state for "Starters who Initiate ," "Initiators who Complete ," and "Completers who Graduate " all increase by 30, while the gap between the desired and current state for "Initiators who Quit Early " is reduced by 30).  These changes do not affect patient care patterns for patients who remain in care after completing their timely dose of psychotherapy.  A team can choose to "Partially" or "Fully" implement the IOP, where "Partial" indicates that only half their patients follow the IOP, and "Fully" indicates that all new patients follow the IOP.
