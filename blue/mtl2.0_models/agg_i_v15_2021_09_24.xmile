				<doc>This controls the magnitude of the effect changes in overtime has on team burnout and quits. A value of "zero" implies that there is no relationship between overtime and burnout and quits. A value of "1" implies the assumption that doubling the hours worked over the official hours will eventually cause enough quits to cut the official hours offered in half. For the same situation, a value of "0.5" would eventually reduce the official team hours to 7117642060260f its original value, and a value of 1.5 would reduce the official hours to 3523205377671f the original.</doc>

				<doc>This controls the magnitude of the effect changes in overtime have on time for non-patient-facing care tasks and missed appointments. A value of "zero" implies that there is no relationship between overtime and missed appointments. A value below 1 indicates that providers are not sensitive to small changes in overtime and non-patient-facing task time; a value greater than 1 indicates that providers are very sensitive to small changes. Example: if a team is putting in 20more hours per week than their official supply, then an value of "1" would indicate that the ratio of missed appointments to all appointments would also be 20 24752gher than before. A value of "0.5" would cause that same 20-1709834311ncrease in hours worked to have less of an effect (causing only a 9.5-1874427848ncrease in the missed appointment percentage). A value of "2" would cause that same 20 179938412ncrease to have a greater effect ( raising the missed appointment percentage by 44).</doc>

				<doc>This controls the magnitude of the effect existing patient care delays have on the team's treatment decisions, where decisions to start patients in a service drop as actual return to clinic visit interval increases (relative to target RVI). A value of "zero" implies that that no amount of care delay will influence the team's treatment decisions. A value of "1" implies that doubling the time between appointments for existing patients (e.g., delaying their care) will reduce the decisions to start in that service by half. For the same situation, a value of "0.5" would reduce the decisions to start in that service to 7117642060260f the original rate, and a value of "1.5" would reduce the decisions to start to only 3523205377671f the original rate.</doc>
