Example: if a team is putting in 20more hours per week than their official supply, then an exponent of "1" would indicate that the ratio of missed appointments to all appointments would also be 20 24752gher than before. A value of "0.5" would cause that same 20 0ncrease in hours worked to have less of an effect (causing only a 9.5 2102718504ncrease in the missed appointment percentage).
