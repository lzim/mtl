A value below 1 indicates that providers are not sensitive to small changes in overtime and non-patient-facing task time; a value greater than 1 indicates that providers are very sensitive to small changes. Example: if a team is putting in 20more hours per week than their official supply, then an value of "1" would indicate that the ratio of missed appointments to all appointments would also be 20 24752gher than before. A value of "0.5" would cause that same 20 0ncrease in hours worked to have less of an effect (causing only a 9.5-824257128ncrease in the missed appointment percentage). A value of "2" would cause that same 20 291826906ncrease to have a greater effect ( raising the missed appointment percentage by 44).</doc>

			<aux name="Sensitivity_of_Treatment_Decisions_to_Existing_Patient_Care_Delays">
				<units>Dmnl</units>
				<doc>This controls the magnitude of the effect existing patient care delays have on the team's treatment decisions, where decisions to start patients in a service drop as actual return to clinic visit interval increases (relative to target RVI). A value of "zero" implies that that no amount of care delay will influence the team's treatment decisions. A value of "1" implies that doubling the time between appointments for existing patients (e.g., delaying their care) will reduce the decisions to start in that service by half. For the same situation, a value of "0.5" would reduce the decisions to start in that service to 71261460260f the original rate, and a value of "1.5" would reduce the decisions to start to only 350f the original rate.</doc>
