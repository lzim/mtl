A value of "zero" implies that the team will not use overtime or overbook appointments for any amount of work pressure. A value of "1" implies that there is a direct relationship between work pressure and the amount of overtime used (e.g., doubling the work pressure will also double the hours worked per week). For the same situation, a value of "0.5" would only increase the hours worked to 41310611450ver the original value, and a value of 1.5 would increase the hours worked to 18251102500ver the original value.</doc>

A value of "1" implies the assumption that doubling provider fatigue (e.g., short-term increases in work hours) will reduce the patients percieved quality of service, and thus patients' willingness to remain in that service by half. For the same situation, a value of "0.5" would reduce the average duration in that service to 71310611450f the original time in service, and a value of 1.5 would reduce the duration to only 3551102500f the original duration.</doc>

A value of "zero" implies that the team will not delay existing patients' care (i.e., extend patients' RVI) for any amount of work pressure. A value of "1" implies that there is a direct relationship between work pressure and RVI (e.g., doubling the work pressure will also double the RVI). For the same situation, a value of "0.5" would only increase the RVI by 41310611450ver its original value, and a value of 1.5 would increase the RVI by 18251102500ver the original value.</doc>

A value of "1" implies the assumption that doubling the hours worked over the official hours will eventually cause enough quits to cut the official hours offered in half. For the same situation, a value of "0.5" would eventually reduce the official team hours to 71310611450f its original value, and a value of 1.5 would reduce the official hours to 3551102500f the original.</doc>

				<units>Dmnl</units>
				<doc>This controls the magnitude of the effect changes in overtime have on time for non-patient-facing care tasks and missed appointments. A value of "zero" implies that there is no relationship between overtime and missed appointments. A value below 1 indicates that providers are not sensitive to small changes in overtime and non-patient-facing task time; a value greater than 1 indicates that providers are very sensitive to small changes. Example: if a team is putting in 20more hours per week than their official supply, then an value of "1" would indicate that the ratio of missed appointments to all appointments would also be 20 4904gher than before. A value of "0.5" would cause that same 20 10782016ncrease in hours worked to have less of an effect (causing only a 9.5 111249808ncrease in the missed appointment percentage).

A value of "zero" implies that that no amount of care delay will influence the team's treatment decisions. A value of "1" implies that doubling the time between appointments for existing patients (e.g., delaying their care) will reduce the decisions to start in that service by half. For the same situation, a value of "0.5" would reduce the decisions to start in that service to 71310611450f the original rate, and a value of "1.5" would reduce the decisions to start to only 3551102500f the original rate.</doc>
