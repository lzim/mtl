				<doc>This controls the magnitude of the effect changes in time for non-patient-facing care tasks has on missed appointments.  A value of "zero" implies that there is no relationship between overbooks and missed appointments. A value below 1 indicates that patients are not sensitive to small changes in non-patient-facing task time; a value greater than 1 indicates that patients are very sensitive to small changes. Example: if a team is putting in 20more hours per week than their official supply, then an exponent of "1" would indicate that the ratio of missed appointments to all appointments would also be 20 7688gher than before. A value of "0.5" would cause that same 20 10782016ncrease in hours worked to have less of an effect (causing only a 9.5 105443936ncrease in the missed appointment percentage).
