## Session 11 Say Checklist

## Today we're modeling to learn how to make future team decisions.

Hello! I'm __________ and I'm __________ [Co-facilitators introduce themselves]. Today we're modeling to learn how to make future team decisions.

**Navigate to the SEE guide to show Done and Do**

- [ ] <img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/done.png" height = "45" width = "45"> **Done** We thought about possible decisions or changes the team could make in clinical care based on our comparison of the bc, exp 1, exp 2 and exp 3 in mtl.how/sim_test.

- [ ] <img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/do.png" height = "45" width = "45"> **Do** We will discuss the team's learning using C.F.B.T. systems thinking skills and prioritize ways to implement new practice decisions in our clinical care.

**Emphasize team priority with the learning objectives on the screen**

**Learning Objectives for Session 11**

1.	Describe what your team has prioritized as decisions to implement in your clinic. 
2.	Test your team’s plan against your individual and shared, team vision.
3.	Apply your team’s plan in clinical decisions using C.F.B.T. systems thinking.

**Facilitator prepare team-tailored C.F.B.T. rationale for the session 11 discussion: We've been _Modeling to Learn_ how to use systems thinking when making care decisions in our team.**
_Prepare your script to model and reflect team decisions using C.F.B.T. systems thinking_

Systems Thinking | Definition
-- | -- 
**Complex** _________________ [team example(s)]| **Forest not trees.** Relationships among two or more **units** (patients, weeks), **variables** (_stocks_: patients waiting to start, _flows_: improvement rate), or two or more **settings** (primary care, general mental health).
**Feedback** _________________ [team example(s)]| **Loop not line.** Not simple cause and effect. The end of the story often influences the beginning, and is strengthened (**reinforcing**)   or reduced (**balancing**) around the loop.
**System Behavior** _________________ [team example(s)]| **Movie not snapshot.** Trends over time. Systems _cause_ their own behavior through feedback.
**Time** _________________ [team example(s)]| **Short and long term.** Better understanding of change over time (e.g., worse before better, better before worse, better before a lot better, worse before a lot worse).

 <img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> _____________ **Time 00:10-00:20** 

- [ ] 1. We've made lots of **team decisions,** including selecting ______________ as team lead.

- [ ] 2. **Shared vision** for *Modeling to Learn* _______________
   
- [ ] 3. In sessions 2 and 3 we found key **team trends** _______________

- [ ] 4. In session 4 we used the *MTL* Menu and identified our **highest priority team need** now __________________

- [ ] 5. In sessions 5 through 10 we learned to tell a **causal system story** of our team's need using the __________________ **causal feedback.**

- [ ] **New individual and team practice decisions** that apply C.F.B.T. systems thinking skills:

- ___________________ [exp 1]

- ___________________ [exp 2]

- ___________________ [exp 3]
   
**Discuss new individual and team practice decisions** using C.F.B.T. systems thinking rationale for why a practice decision would lead to desired outcomes over time.
<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> _____________ **Time 00:20-00:50**  

1. **What shared vision did the team decide on in session 1?**
2. **What team need and questions did we identify?**
3. **What hypotheses did we test?**
4. **What insights will we keep in mind as we make clinic decisions?**
5. **What new approaches or targets do we want to focus on?**
6. **What concrete actions can the team take in the real world?**
7. **How do these decisions align with the team's shared vision, question and needs?**
8. **What data will we watch to see how we're doing?**

**Have Team Lead pull up the session 11 SEE guide Done/Do review.**

- [ ] Done: We discussed the team's learning and new individual and team practice decisions that apply C.F.B.T. systems thinking skills in prioritized ways to implement it in our clinical care.
- [ ] Do: Reflect on our team's vision for _MTL_ and our _MTL_ experience to prepare for planning next steps.
