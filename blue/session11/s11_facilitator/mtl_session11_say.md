# MTL Live Session 11

## Today we're modeling to learn how to make _future_ team decisions

Hello! I'm \________________ (facilitator's name) and I'm \_______________ (co-facilitator's name). Today we're modeling to learn how to make future team decisions.

**As you can see in the Done/Do table in the Learner See Guide:**

## Learning Objectives

1. Describe what your team has prioritized as decisions to implement in your clinic.
2. Test your team's plan against your individual and shared team vision.
3. Apply your team's plan in clinical decisions using C.F.B.T. systems thinking.

## Let's get started

## In-session Exercise (30 minutes): Pulling together team learnings, decisions, and vision

## Connect learning and decisions from experiments to original team vision, question, and need

### 1. What shared vision did the team decide on in session 1?

- Throughout *Modeling to Learn*, we've made lots of team decisions. Let's review them and see what they mean for future decisions. What shared vision for *Modeling to Learn* did the team decide on in Session 1? We've tied our experiments and decisions throughout *MTL* to that vision.

### 2. What team need and questions did we identify?

- In sessions 2 and 3 we explored team data and trends using the *MTL* data UI. We learned how to find an individual patient, how to visualize trends over time for our own care or the teams' as a whole. And we built our team data file for use in the sim. In session 4 we completed the *MTL* Menu to prioritize our team's need. What questions did we identify and study over the next 5 sessions, using the sim UI to better understand the **causal systems story** of our team's need over time?

### 3. What hypotheses did we test?

### 4. What insights will we keep in mind as we make clinic decisions?

- Let's discuss what our Findings and Decisions mean for the team going forward. _As we discuss new individual and team practice decisions keep in mind the systems thinking rationale for **why** a practice decision would lead to desired outcomes over time._ As we discuss these questions consider **Complexity,** **Feedback,** and **System Behavior** over **Time.** What insights will we keep in mind as we make future clinic decisions?

### 5. What new approaches or targets do we want to focus on?

- Let's think about the key insights we've gotten about decisions that are within our control.

### 6. What concrete actions will the team take in the real world?

### 7. How do these decisions align with the team's shared vision, question and needs?

### 8. What data will we watch to see how we're doing?

## That's it for _Modeling to Learn_ how to make _future team decisions_. Next is our Done/Do review.

## Done and Do (15 minutes)

### DO demo

1. After we complete *Modeling to Learn* next time, you can still access ALL the *MTL* resources.
2. You can log in to the sim UI and review all the experiments saved in the Team and Individual worlds.
3. You can run new experiments in the same module, or in any of the other 4 _MTL_ modules.
4. You can log in to the data UI and look at all sorts of team and individual trends.
5. And of course, there are many materials and links at mtl.how.
6. For next time, as you have time, look back at those resources to refresh your memory, and be thinking about how they might be useful to you after *MTL*.

**Until next time, thank you for *Modeling to Learn*!**
