## 2. Sessions 1-4 - Partner to identify the team's highest priority learning need now. 

Session | Priority| Participatory Learning 
-- | -- | --
s1 | Shared Vision | The team practices making team decisions as they move from an individual to shared vision, select their team lead and team meeting time
s2 | Team Data Trends | The team learns to evaluate their own team data trends and patient data in relation to their team vision.
s3 | Team Data for Simulation | The team selects the data that makes sense for their own context and shared vision, and builds the set of parameters they will use for "what if" simulation learning.
s4 | Team Need | The team engages in a dialogue about the highest priority team need now, so that there is consensus around the _MTL_ Learning Module selected for sessions 5-10.

## 3. Sessions 1-4 - How to prioritize and practice during co-facilitator prep:

1. **Document in the teams co-facilitator prep channel the themes and differential questions related to the teams need.**
   - **NEED:** **Current working conceptualization of this team's need?**
   - **DIFFERENTIATE:** **I need to rule in (      ) or rule out (      ) during next session.**

2. Specific **themes** (qualitative) the team brought up when visioning during session 1. ___
3. Specific **values** (quantitative) in the team data table (sessions 2 and 3) that reveal the team's highest priority need: ___
4. Prioritized data-related **frequently asked questions** (FAQs) related to the team's highest priority need: ___
5. **Synthesize**
- [ ] multiple team member's **points of view** ___ 
- [ ] multiple **variables** that are related to one another (e.g., RVI and engagement duration) ___
- [ ] problems related in their **dynamics (over time)** ___
- [ ] **throughline** across learning sessions. ___

<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> 00:15-00:20 | **Review** to identify the themes from the team vision that should be highlighted in the team data. | **1. In the SAY checklist, fill in the specific themes the team brought up when visioning during session 1.**
<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> 00:20-00:25 | **Plan** reflections for team responses to the prompt questions that relate to the team's vision. | **2. In the SAY checklist, fill in the specific values in the Team Data table (sessions 2 and 3) that reveal the team's highest priority need.**
<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> 00:25-00:35 | **Prioritize** the answers to FAQs most related to the team's need. | **3a. In the SAY checklist, fill in the prioritized frequently asked questions (FAQs) and practice relating them to the team's highest priority need.**
<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> 00:35-00:40  | **Explain** the participatory rationale for why teams' can "drive" themselves and can access additional information or request updates related to the data. | **3b. Practice explaining the reasons to empower the team with local transparent data resources.**
<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> 00:40-00:50 | **Reflect** with your co-facilitator double-check your thinking about the team's relative consensus about their priorities _before_ going to the MTL menu in session 4. | **4. Prepare and practice reflections that synthesize a) multiple team member's points of view, b) multiple variables that are related to one another (e.g., RVI and engagement duration), c) multiple problems that are likely related, and c) the "throughline" across learning sessions.** 
<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> 00:50-00:60 | **Success** - A successful Done/Do Review is short, specific, simple and shown.

## 4. There are 3 primary facilitation goals and emphases across the 12-Session plan.

_MTL_ Sessions | Primary Goal | Emphasis | Team Time Report
-- | -- | -- | --
**1-4** | **Partner** to identify and validate the team's highest priority learning need now. | **participatory learning** | **tt1**
**5-8** | **Build** capacity for participatory learning from simulation using team question/hypothesis/findings/decisions. | **participatory learning + systems thinking** | **tt2**
**9-12** | **Apply**Â C.F.B.T. systems thinking and plan for future team learning needs. Ideally, the team has been practicing new decisions and may also now be ready to implement a shared change in the real world. | **systems thinking** | **tt3**
