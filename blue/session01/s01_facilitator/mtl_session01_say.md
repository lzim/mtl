# Today we're modeling to learn how to align our team vision.

Hello! I'm \________________ (facilitator's name) and I'm \_______________ (co-facilitator's name). Today we're modeling to learn how to align our team vision.

Throughout _Modeling to Learn_, we will start each session in our Learner See Guide at MTL.HOW, which is what we're sharing on our screen now. We'll review what was Done prior to the session and what we will Do in the session, as well as the specific MTL resources that we'll be using.

In the Session 1 Done and Do table, you can see that for today, we joined the Microsoft Teams meeting invitation from Outlook and called in, if needed. Your home base is mtl.how for ALL of the tools and resources we'll use in _Modeling to Learn_, so if you ever forget a link or anything, just type mtl.how into your browser.

Our DO for this session is to Launch _Modeling to Learn_ and select a Team Vision for _MTL_.

**By the end of this session you will be able to:**

1. Describe your own vision for what you would like your team to get from *Modeling to Learn*.

2. Test out your thinking with your team about what your shared vision is for becoming a "dream team."

3. Identify a shared team vision for learning from _Modeling to Learn_.

**Let's get started!**

## In-session Exercise (30 minutes): Team vision

- We learn best when we seek to accomplish things that matter to us. Today we will clarify what we are trying to accomplish together with _Modeling to Learn_. This learning process will be something you commit to because it reflects a key part your own vision for care in this team.
- Identifying a shared purpose can be deeply motivating. We want to identify a shared purpose about what we are trying to achieve as a team participating in _Modeling to Learn_. The team learning goal provides the focus and energy for committing to learning together over the coming weeks. We have limited time, so we want to identify what is most central to team learning goals and connect this to daily team care delivery.
- Team learning is all about ‘alignment’ and getting people working in sync with one another to meet the needs of our Veteran patients. We will explore “what is” (retrospective data) and vision forward to “what we would like it to be” (future-oriented).
- The goal is to move from “my vision” to “our vision” and to shift the paradigm towards how things could be done with shared decision-making. Together, the clinic team lead and facilitation team will explore “What can be done better?” in a way that reflects common team aspirations.

### 1. Prior Team Learning Prompt (5 minutes)

a. First, we want to set ground rules for our learning sessions. Think of a good learning experience in your team. It can be in a meeting or an informal exchange with a colleague. It can be when you learned a clinic procedure, an idea for treatment with a difficult patient, or when a team member unlocked a mystery of CPRS for you. Try to think of a time when you had an “aha!” Something finally made sense, or you could finally do something you couldn’t before.

b. Jot down on scratch paper what it was that made it a good learning experience. What were the characteristics of the experience? Compile a team list.

- *Most likely the following are true:*  
  - The learning was hands-on and experiential.
  - The learning is connected to the real world.
  - The learning experience was personally relevant, interesting, useful, or meaningful to the learner.
  - The learner had choices, shared authority, control, and responsibility.
  - The learner learned from and taught others.
  - The learner had the support he or she needed.
  - The learning was individualized. If there were standards for the work, the learner could meet them in his or her own way.
  - It was fun or left the learner feeling good.
  - The experience helped the learner understand him- or herself.
  - The learner experienced success and accomplishment with challenging work.  

### 2. Best Case Scenario (5 minutes)

a. Now let's envision our *Best Case Scenario*. It is important to create a team language for learning; for aligning team decisions when there are roadblocks to consensus. Start by picturing Veteran mental health care in this team as you experience it now. The interactions and communications within the team, in and out of team meetings. The key people you rely on outside the team. The information and data you use to coordinate care plans, and the feelings you associate with it.

b. Now picture the team learning over the next 6 months in a *best case* scenario, where things are happening in the team the way that you would ideally like them to. This is your *dream team* situation.

### 3. Personal Vision (5 minutes)

- Think about your Personal Vision for your team:

  a. What is team communication like?
  
  b. How do team members relate to one another?
  
  c. How is VA data used?
  
  d. How are decisions, plans and changes made?
  
### 4. Review in Team (5 minutes)  

- Reflecting as a team on those individual visions:

  a. What stands out to you?

  b. Why did we choose these?

  c. What makes them so relevant or important to us?

  d. Can we address them all (bearing in mind our resources and time)?

  e. If not, which would we most like to address (align around), and why?

### 5. Putting it Together (5 minutes)  

- Putting it all together, overall *Modeling to Learn* objectives include activities and competencies that:

  a. Are meaningful for you and align your learning goals with your team.
  
  b. Develop systems thinking skills that help you to see how several things fit together and understand causes that are hard to see without data and modeling resources.
  
  c. Make VA data, initiatives and standards transparent to you.
  
  d. Empower you to realize ongoing improvements in team quality of care and team quality of work life.

### 6. Select the Team Vision and a Team Lead (5 minutes)

- To wrap up, let's home in on our Team Vision

  a. You can further word-smith the Team Vision after the session if you want.
  
  b. We'll hold this vision up as a reminder of our shared goals to orient our learning throughout the *MTL* program.
  
- Furthermore, let's decide on a Team Lead. The role of the Team Lead is to:

  1. be the main point of contact between the team and *Modeling to Learn* co-facilitators;

  2. become familiar with *MTL* resources and help team members trouble-shoot - mainly Microsoft Teams (used for screen-sharing during meetings), mtl.how/data_test (the data user interface), mtl.how/sim (the simulation user interface); and

  3. provide leadership during *MTL* sessions, encouraging team participation in discussions and serving as computer simulation lead under co-facilitators' guidance.  

    - Ideal characteristics of the Team Lead include:

       - Having strong relationships with fellow team members;

       - Being organized;

       - Having basic computer knowledge (some Excel experience is good);

       - Attention to detail; and

       - Commitment to process improvement and the use of data to improve care.

**That's it for _Modeling to Learn_ how to align our team vision! Next is our Done/Do review**

We selected a Team Vision to orient our learning throughout the *MTL* program. We will hold this vision up as a reminder of our shared goals to orient our learning throughout *MTL*. <br> 2. We decided on a Team Lead! Email us at mtl.help@va.gov for any questions from the team. | [<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/logos/mtl_how_data_sm.png" height = "75" width = "110">](http://mtl.how/data_test) 1. We will reach out to schedule and prep the data file for Session 2 with the Team Lead. <br> 2. Go to mtl.how/data_test to see your team's data folder. |

## DO Demo

1. All team members will receive a post-session email the week after each session from the *Modeling to Learn* staff, with Done and Do reminders and links to the necessary resources; and another pre-session email the week of the upcoming session.  

2. We will email the Team Lead to set up a one-time hour prep before our next meeting. 

3. Before our next meeting, check to see if you can see your team folder at mtl.how/data_test. 
   - First, go to any browser and type in mtl.how/data_test in the top search bar. Then, select your VISN and then your facility. 
      - This is where you can access your local team data files on a secure VA site. 
   - See if you can click into your team's folder.

**Until next time, thank you for _Modeling to Learn_!**
