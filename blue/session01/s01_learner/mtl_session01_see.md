## Learning Objectives

1. Describe your own vision for what you would like your team to get from *Modeling to Learn*.

2. Test out your thinking with your team about what your shared vision is for becoming a "dream team."

3. Identify a shared team vision for learning from *Modeling to Learn*.

## In-session Exercise 

### 1. Think of a good learning experience in your team. 

a. **A time when you had an ‘aha!’ or something finally made sense, or you could finally do something you couldn’t before.** It can be in a meeting or an informal exchange with a colleague. It can be when you learned a clinic procedure, an idea for treatment with a difficult patient, or when a team member unlocked a mystery of CPRS for you. 

b. **What were the characteristics of the experience?** 

c. **Jot down on scratch paper** what it was that made it a good learning experience. 

d. **Compile a team list.**

*Most likely the following are true:*
  - The learning was hands-on and experiential.
  - The learning connected to the real world.
  - The learning experience was personally relevant, interesting, useful, or meaningful to the learner.
  - The learner had choices, shared authority, control, and responsibility.
  - The learner learned from and taught others.
  - The learner had the support he or she needed.
  - The learning was individualized. If there were standards for the work, the learner could meet them in his or her own way.
  - It was fun or left the learner feeling good.
  - The experience helped the learner understand him- or herself.
  - The learner experienced success and accomplishment with challenging work.

### 2. Envision a Best Case Scenario. 

a. **It is important to create team language for learning, aligning team decisions when there are roadblocks to consensus.** Start by picturing Veteran mental health care in this team as you experience it now – the interactions/communications within the team in and out of team meetings; the key people you rely on outside the team; the information and data you use to coordinate care plans, and the feelings you associate with it.

b. Now picture the team learning over the next 6 months in a **‘best-case’ scenario**, where things are happening in the team the way that you would ideally like them to. This is your “dream team” situation.

### 3. Create a Personal Vision for this 'best-case' scenario.

**a. What is team communication like?**

**b. How do team members relate to one another?**

**c. How is VA data used?**

**d. How are decisions, plans and changes made?**

### 4. Review together with the Team.

**a. What stands out to you?**

**b. Why did we choose these?**

**c. What makes them so relevant or important to us?**

**d. Can we address them all (bearing in mind our resources and time)?**

**e. If not, which would we most like to address (align around), and why?**

### 5. Put it together and hone in on your Team Vision.

a. **We'll hold this vision up as a reminder of our shared goals to orient our learning throughout the *MTL* program.**
  
b. You can further word-smith the Team Vision after the session if you want.
  
Overall "_Modeling to Learn_" objectives include activities and competencies that:

- Are meaningful for you and align your learning goals with your team's.
- Develop systems thinking skills - help you see how several things fit together and understand causes that are hard to see without data and modeling resources.
- Make VA data, initiatives and standards transparent to you.
- Empower you to realize ongoing improvements in team quality of care and team quality of work life.

### 6. Select a Team Lead.
 
-  The role of the Team Lead is to:
1. Be the main point of contact between the team and *Modeling to Learn* co-facilitators;
2. Become familiar with *MTL* resources and help team members trouble-shoot - mainly Microsoft Teams (used for screen-sharing during meetings), mtl.how/data (the data user interface), mtl.how/sim (the simulation user interface); and
3. Provide leadership during *MTL* sessions, encouraging team participation in discussions and serving as computer simulation lead under co-facilitators' guidance.  

- Ideal characteristics of the Team Lead include:
   - Having strong relationships with fellow team members;
   - Being organized;
   - Having basic computer knowledge (some Excel experience is good);
   - Attention to detail; and
   - Commitment to process improvement and the use of data to improve care.
