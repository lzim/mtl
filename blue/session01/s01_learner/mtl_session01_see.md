# MTL Live Session 01

## Today we're modeling to learn how to align our team vision.

## Learning Objectives

1. Describe your own vision for what you would like your team to get from *Modeling to Learn*.

2. Test out your thinking with your team about what your shared vision is for becoming a "dream team."

3. Identify a shared team vision for learning from *Modeling to Learn*.

## In-session Exercise (30 minutes)

### 1. Prior Team Learning Prompt (5 minutes)

a. Think of a good learning experience in your team. It can be in a meeting or an informal exchange with a colleague. It can be when you learned a clinic procedure, an idea for treatment with a difficult patient, or when a team member unlocked a mystery of CPRS for you. Try to think of a time when you had an ‘aha!’ or something finally made sense, or you could finally do something you couldn’t before.

b. Jot down on scratch paper what it was that made it a good learning experience. What were the characteristics of the experience? Compile a team list:

- *Most likely the following are true:*
  - The learning was hands-on and experiential.
  - The learning connected to the real world.
  - The learning experience was personally relevant, interesting, useful, or meaningful to the learner.
  - The learner had choices, shared authority, control, and responsibility.
  - The learner learned from and taught others.
  - The learner had the support he or she needed.
  - The learning was individualized. If there were standards for the work, the learner could meet them in his or her own way.
  - It was fun or left the learner feeling good.
  - The experience helped the learner understand him- or herself.
  - The learner experienced success and accomplishment with challenging work.

### 2. Best Case Scenario (5 minutes)

a. Create team language for learning, aligning team decisions when there are roadblocks to consensus. Start by picturing Veteran mental health care in this team as you experience it now – the interactions/communications within the team in and out of team meetings; the key people you rely on outside the team; the information and data you use to coordinate care plans, and the feelings you associate with it.

b. Now picture the team learning over the next 6 months in a ‘best-case’ scenario, where things are happening in the team the way that you would ideally like them to. This is your “dream team” situation.

### 3. Personal Vision (5 minutes)

a. What is team communication like?

b. How do team members relate to one another?

c. How is VA data used?

d. How are decisions, plans and changes made?

### 4. Review in Team (5 minutes)

a. What stands out to you?

b. Why did we choose these?

c. What makes them so relevant or important to us?

d. Can we address them all (bearing in mind our resources and time)?

e. If not, which would we most like to address (align around), and why?

### 5. Putting it Together (5 minutes)

Overall "_Modeling to Learn_" objectives include activities and competencies that:

a. Are meaningful for you and align your learning goals with your team's.

b. Develop systems thinking skills - help you see how several things fit together and understand causes that are hard to see without data and modeling resources.

c. Make VA data, initiatives and standards transparent to you.

d. Empower you to realize ongoing improvements in team quality of care and team quality of work life.

### 6. Select the Team Vision and a Team Lead (5 minutes)

- To wrap up, let's home in on our Team Vision

  a. You can further word-smith the Team Vision after the session if you want.
  
  b. We'll hold this vision up as a reminder of our shared goals to orient our learning throughout the *MTL* program.
  
- Furthermore, let's decide on a Team Lead. The role of the Team Lead is to:

  1. be the main point of contact between the team and *Modeling to Learn* co-facilitators;

  2. become familiar with *MTL* resources and help team members trouble-shoot - mainly Microsoft Teams (used for screen-sharing during meetings), mtl.how/data (the data user interface), mtl.how/sim (the simulation user interface); and

  3. provide leadership during *MTL* sessions, encouraging team participation in discussions and serving as computer simulation lead under co-facilitators' guidance.  

    - Ideal characteristics of the Team Lead include:

       - Having strong relationships with fellow team members;

       - Being organized;

       - Having basic computer knowledge (some Excel experience is good);

       - Attention to detail; and

       - Commitment to process improvement and the use of data to improve care.
