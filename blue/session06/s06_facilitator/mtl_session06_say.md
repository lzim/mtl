## Learning Objectives

1. Describe the systems story of your team's highest priority.

2. Test out your thinking about causes of team challenges using the model diagram.

3. Apply clinical expertise to develop a question for team learning using simulation.

## In-session Exercise (30 minutes)

### Start in-session exercise and provide team-specific rationale for building capacity for participatory learning from simulation.

**The purpose for this activity is to familiarize you with the model diagram and how causal diagrams can be useful to understanding why problems arise and persist. By the end, you should be able to easily navigate it and find detailed information about each variable.  This exercise has two parts, the first to practice navigating to your Team simulation world, and the second to use the diagram  to help you tell your Systems Story.  A Systems Story is a description of the causal connections that create the problem your team prioritized, \_________________.**

### Team lead shares Chrome and logs in to the Team world at **mtl.how/test/sim_test.**

[<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/>](#DontClick)   \_____________ **Time 00:15-00:20 - Team's Session 05 Question** \__________________

### Let's explore the MTL Home Page.

- To start this session, you should log in to your team world at **mtl.how/test/sim_test**, where you enter your username (email address) and password. After you click **LOGIN**, a pop-up box will appear with the text "Please select a World" on the blue bar. Select the world that ends with **"team" from the drop-down menu**.
- Once you're on the _MTL_ Home Page, look over on the **left section with Session in the blue heading bar**.

- Since we logged in to the Team World last time, you'll see the **name of the module and the dataset we chose under the first option**, Join Current Session. Select that and hit Play.

- Now check what you're seeing against what we're showing on the screen. It should have your TEAM name at the **top left**, and YOUR name and photo at the **top right**, and YOUR team's dataset listed in the **blue bar of the main section above the model diagram, here**.

- Also, depending on the size of your monitor and whether your browser window is full-screen or less, you might see more or less than what we're showing of the model section. The model screen is a dynamic graphic, so the main model diagram will adjust if you re-size the browser window.
  - On a PC, you can re-size your screen to get more or less of the diagram to show up at once by clicking the **stacked boxes icon in the far top right** of your computer screen.
  - On a MAC, to view the model in full screen click the **green button in the upper left of the browser** on your computer. To exit full screen, hover at the top of your computer screen, the toolbar will appear, click on "View", click on "Exit Full Screen."

- Navigate to Text section to pull up the Question from last time.

## In-Session Exercise - Part 1

## Introducing the Simulation User Interface Main Section with the Model Diagram in relation to team's priority.

[<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/>](#DontClick)   \_____________ **Time 00:20-00:30 - Team Priority**\__________________

**Now we're ready to explore the simulation user interface main section with the model diagram in relation to your team.**  

### 1. Over what time frame does an experiment run?

See the box titled Experiment Timeline in the top corner of the diagram section. This shows the time frame over which an experiment will run. What is the maximum time into the future you can simulate? Two years from today.

### 2. Where do you find the descriptions for each variable in the module? Paste a portion of a description from one of the Rates into the chat box.

Notice the blue circle "i" in the diagram. These provide information on how model variables are calculated by the sim UI from the red variables that are read in from team data. The small circles with i inside throughout the sim UI provide additional information when you click on them. Red circle "i" in the team data table provides information for the red variables that are read in from team data. Circle "i" in the Experiments section provides information on what you're changing when you adjust a variable to run an experiment.

### 3. Describe in one sentence what happens in the model diagram as you "Reveal Complexity?"

Inside the Experiment Timeline box you also see a set of options to Reveal Complexity. You can select check-boxes to bring more of the model diagram into view, or uncheck the boxes to make it less visually complex. The amount of detail showing in the model diagram does NOT affect your experiments; the model always accounts for all the complexity regardless of how much is being viewed at the time.

### 4. What is the significance of the variables in the "red boxes"?

In our convention, Red means read in from team data.

## In-Session Exercise - Part 2

## Introducing stocks/flows and polarities among key variables related to the team's priority.

[<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/>](#DontClick)   \_____________ **Time 00:30-00:40  - Team Priority**\__________________

- **Starting Point: Main model section with no additional complexities revealed.**

***Tip:* If you are not able to see the whole model diagram at once, try altering the size of the window using the browser's expand/reduce button and dragging the frame. The display will adjust to a stacked format that will get more of the diagram into one view.**  

- **Imagine a veteran in care. Tell the systems story told by the diagram in real-life terms.  Make notes where you have questions or are unsure about the relationships depicted. Describe the connection between the model diagram and the team data table. How are they linked?**
  - What are the main units _Modeling to Learn_?
    - Appointments/week
    - Patients/week
    - Episodes of Care (SP): Episodes of Care appears on the model diagram for Measurement Based Stepped Care and Suicide Prevention and in the Team Data Table. However, all of the Output charts are still in the units of appointments, appointments/week, patients, or patients/week.
- Let's do a quick orientation to the model diagram.
  - The navy blue circles or gauges are always a rate. The navy blue rectangles are patients or appointments.
  - In telling a systems story, we want to trace the loop all the way around until we are back where we started - so that we close the feedback loop and fully understand why behaviors happen in our clinics.
  - On the model diagram, you see plus and minus signs next to the blue lines. **Use Thumbs to demonstrate +/- concept:**
  - If there is a plus sign between two variables, this means they move in the same direction (thumbs both up for increasing or both down for decreasing).
    - If there is a minus sign, the two variables move in opposite directions (1 thumb up, 1 thumb down; and reverse).

## Cover complexity reveal (causal loop) and base case question and dynamic hypothesis related to the team's priority.

### Table of System Stories

| ***MODULE*** | ***-- Loop --*** |
|------:|:-----|
| **CARE COORDINATION** | **-- Wait Time Affects Referrals --** |
|  |  We'll reveal the "Wait Time Affects Referrals" detail in the Care Coordination or CC model diagram. Then, scroll down to the lower left of the model diagram to see what has been revealed. Remember, if you're not sure how a variable is defined, check the *i* descriptions on the model diagram or in the *Experiments* section.  The *Wait Time Affects Referrals* detail shows the connection between patient *Referral Rates*, patients *Waiting to Start* CC and *Target Wait Times* for patients. For this activity of telling a systems story, we are concerned patients are having to wait longer than we would like to start Care Coordination.  
| |  So, we'll start this systems story with the *Referral Rate* - the green box. As a clinician you know that when *Referral Rates* increase, there is an increase in the back log of patients *Waiting to Start* a service, in this case CC.  As the patients *Waiting to Start* increases, the average *New Patient Wait Time* starts to climb. Note the plus sign from *Waiting to Start* to *New Patient Wait Time* which indicates they will move in the same direction. So, if the patients *Waiting to Start* decreases, the *New Patient Wait Time* will decrease also. Let's continue with the assumption that *New Patient Wait Time* is increasing. As this wait time increases, it increases the *Effect of Wait Time on Referrals* which decreases the *Referral Rate* so referrals to CC begin to slow down.  Patients may be kept in or referred to other services so that they don't have to wait longer than the desired or target wait time for their first CC appointment.  In addition to running experiments around our Target Wait Time, this loop shows that we can also experiment with team decisions about Referral Rate. We can ask questions like, "If the Referral Rate to CC goes up by some percentage because we've started graduating patients more quickly from other services - but our Starting Rate in CC stays the same because we don't have any extra appointment slots for new patients - what will become the 'new normal' for New Patient Wait Times in CC?"|
| **MEDICATION MANAGEMENT** | **-- Wait Time Affects Referrals --** |
| | We'll reveal the "Wait Time Affects Referrals" detail in the Medication Management or MM model diagram. Then, scroll down to the lower left of the model diagram to see what has been revealed. Remember, if you're not sure how a variable is defined, check the *i* descriptions on the model diagram or in the *Experiments* section. The *Wait Time Affects Referrals* detail shows the connection between patient *Referral Rates*, patients *Waiting to Start* MM and *Target Wait Times* for patients. We hear a lot of clinicians say that good, ethical treatment is if you start a patient on medication assistance, the patient should come in for a monthly evaluation. If a clinician isn't sure they can get a patient in for a monthly appointment, then they may decide not to start the patient on the service. For this activity of telling a systems story in the Med Management module, we would like to explore how our team can serve more patients with specific conditions, like Opioid Use Disorder (OUD), with our existing staffing levels.
|| We'll start this systems story with the *Referral Rate* - the green box. As a clinician you know that when *Referral Rates* increase, there is an increase in the back log of patients *Waiting to Start* a service, in this case MM.  As the patients *Waiting to Start* increases, the average *New Patient Wait Time* starts to climb. Note the plus sign from *Waiting to Start* to *New Patient Wait Time* which indicates they will move in the same direction. So, if the patients *Waiting to Start* decreases, the *New Patient Wait Time* will decrease also.
|| Let's continue with the assumption that *New Patient Wait Time* is increasing. As this wait time increases, it increases the *Effect of Wait Time on Referrals*. The *Effect of Wait Time on Referrals* is the difference between the *New Patient **Actual** Wait Time* and the team's desired or *Target Wait Time*.  In the Med Management module, we can adjust target wait times for different diagnostic patients. The "stacked" red boxes labeled *Target Wait Time* indicates you can change the target wait time by adjusting the red sliders read in from your team data for patients with Alcohol Use Disorder, Opioid Use Disorder, Depression and Other conditions.  The effect of an increasing wait time on referrals, which has a negative sign, means a decrease to the *Referral Rate* so referrals to MM begin to slow down.  Patients may be kept in or referred to other services so that they don't have to wait longer than the desired or target wait time for their first MM appointment.   |
|  **PSYCHOTHERAPY** | **-- Balancing Existing and New Patients; Engagement After 3 Months --** |
||The Psychotherapy or PSY module shows how team psychotherapy decisions interact, and depicts patterns of psychotherapy engagement in your team. You can explore solutions to the challenges of getting patients to complete a full course of therapy, while also achieving goals to start enough new patients in psychotherapy. Insights about these dynamics can be used to increase the local reach of evidence-based psychotherapies.  We'll reveal the "Balancing Patients" detail in the PSY model diagram.  Remember, if you're not sure how a variable is defined, check the *i* descriptions on the model diagram or in the *Experiments* section.  For this activity of telling a systems story, we want patients to complete a full course of PSY without decreasing the new patients that can start psychotherapy. So, if you as a clinician are totally full in your PSY slots, the only way you can start new patients is if patients quit or patients complete. Let's scroll down the model diagram to see what has been revealed in the blue shaded box titled *Patients in Their First 3 Months of Psychotherapy*.
|| The *Reveal Complexity* detail for Balancing Patients shows the flow of patients and appointments in the PSY model. We see patients start psychotherapy and a certain number of patients get their first visit of PSY and end there; you can see this in the model here [use mouse to show "Patients in First Visit"]. We know that other patients will go on for additional visits. In the model diagram, we can explore data for patients who attend 2 to 7 visits [use mouse to show "Patients in Visit 2 to 7"] but they haven't yet completed a full course of PSY. Next, there is a subset of patients will go on to achieve 7 or more visits in their own first 3 months. Some will graduate and some will continue treatment after 3 months. Obviously our team wants patients to complete a full course of PSY without decreasing the new patients that can start.
|| So, starting on the left side of the screen in the blue box. We can see that as the *Starting Rate* for PSY increases, it increases the Booking Rate. Remember, we follow the blue line upward to *Booking Rate* and there is a plus *+* sign which means the Starting Rate and Booking Rate move in the same direction. As the *Booking Rate* increases, this increases the appointments on the books for PSY [use mouse to show booking rate to appointments in PSY].  As the overall appointment supply goes up it can increase the overall appointments for new patients or existing patients. So, as the *Appointments in Psychotherapy* increases, we follow the light blue arrow to *Appointments for Existing Patients* and see that plus *+* sign indicating an increase in appointments on the books for existing patients.  As the appointments for existing patients goes up, it decreases the appointments for new patients, as this goes down it decreases the *Starting rate* as shown with the long blue arrow down the left side of the screen that connects *Additional Appointments Available to New Patients* to *Starting Rate* with a plus *+* sign.
|**AGGREGATE** |**-- Appointment Backlog Extends Return Visit Interval (under RVI and Wait Times) --**|
||Because the Aggregate or AGG model includes a mix of services, the *Experiment Timeline* box has two options: *Reveal Complexity* and *Display Patient Services*. If you click through the services listed under *Display Patient Services* you will see the numbers change in the dark blue circles and rectangles in the model diagram. This represents the our team's appointments and patients data for each service. Remember, if you're not sure how a variable is defined, check the *i* descriptions on the model diagram or in the *Experiments* section.  Let's show the "RVI and Wait Times" under *Reveal Complexity* in the AGG model.  Our team is going to be losing two staff members in the near future. Since the aggregate module shows the interactions between all services offered by our team, we want to use this module to explore how we can best allocate appointments across services with reduced staffing levels. We also want to know what will happen to patient wait times if we change patient return-to-clinic visit intervals (RVI) and/or if the remaining staff members decide to work overtime or not.
|| Let's walk through a systems story focused on the balancing loop titled "Appointment Backlog Extends Return Visit Interval right here on the model diagram [mouse over balancing loop on screen].  Let's start In the Appointments section of the diagram with the *Booking Rate*. As the *Booking Rate* goes up, the *Appointments* increase. If there are more patients who need an appointment then there are appointments or clinical hours available, clinicians may feel work pressure. This is the light blue arrow with the plus *+* sign leading from *Appointments* to *Work Pressure*.
 ||When a clinic team experiences increasing *Work Pressure* then there is an *Effect of Work Pressure on Scheduled Return Visit INterval* such that as work pressure increases, there is an increases the time between appointments or the *Return to Clinic Visit Interval*.  As the *Return to Visit Interval* increases the *Booking Rate* decreases, you can tell this by the negative sign at the end of the light blue arrow leading from RVI to Booking Rate. Thus, the balancing loop is *Appointment Backlog Extends Return Visit Interval* is complete.
|**MEASUREMENT-BASED STEPPED CARE AND SUICIDE PREVENTION**| **-- Higher Care Quality Improves Recovery --**|
||Starting with *Patient Load*, which is [CLICK ON I TEXT AND READ], one way that increasing patient load influences the team is the effect on care quality. If the team has fewer patients than they can effectively treat, then the effect on quality decreases, and the care quality delivered to patients increases.  When *Care Quality* increases, the number of patients in the grey box labeled *Effect of MBC on Patient Symptoms and Risk* decreases, which then decreases *Patient Load*, further increasing *Care Quality*.  Let's zoom in to this part of the diagram to see how that works by clicking on the plus sign in the upper right corner of the grey box [CLICK ON MEASUREMENT BASED CARE VIEW].
||Here we see some of our same variables, including *Care Quality*, which has the same causal relationships in this view as in the previous view.  When *Care Quality* goes up, two things happen:  First, high-symptom patients improve faster than before (see the arrow to “Time to Improve” which affects the number of patients each week whose symptoms improve enough to be eligible to be stepped down to a less intense level of care), and  Second, patients with high risk flags improve faster than before (see the arrow to “Time to UnFlag” which affects the rate at which patients with high risk flags have those flags removed).
|| This causes more patients to flow into the “low symptom” group, so more patients can both end their care and be recommended to step down to a lower level of care. Now, click any one of the plus signs in a grey box to zoom out to the previous view [TOGGLE BACK TO STEPPED CARE VIEW]. As more patients leave this setting, it further reduces the total number of patients in the GMH treatment setting, thus further decreasing the patient load and increasing quality. When moving this direction, this type of reinforcing loop is often called a “virtuous circle.”  However, this feedback loop also works in the opposite direction, where small increases in patients can lead to lower quality, more patients staying with “high symptoms,” resulting in even higher patient load. When this happens, this same loop is referred to as a “vicious circle,” or a “death spiral.” We have closed the loop, or brought our chain of causation full circle, and can now explain how this reinforcing loop of "Higher Care Quality Improves Recovery" could both energize our improvement efforts, or potentially derail them.
||**-- Higher Care Quality Improves Recovery Loop --**|
||In the Stepped Care View, start with Patient Load, which is the ratio of the total number of patients seen over the manageable total patients (i.e., demand over supply). One way that increasing patient load influences the team is the effect on care quality. If the team has fewer patients than they can effectively treat, then the effect on quality decreases, and the care quality delivered to patients increases.  In the clinic, there could be many possible reasons for this effect: providers have more time to document and prep for each visit, more time to discuss cases as a team, more time for reminder calls, so more patients actually show up for their appointments, etc.
|| When Care Quality increases, the number of patients in the grey box labeled Effect of MBC on Patient Symptoms and Risk decreases, which then decreases Patient Load, further increasing Care Quality.  To see why this happens, zoom in to the part of the model that covers what happens inside the team (in the Measurement Based Care View). Here we see some of our same variables, including Care Quality, which has the same causal relationships in this view as in the previous view. When Care Quality goes up, two things happen: First, high-symptom patients improve faster than before (see the arrow to “Time to Improve” which affects the number of patients each week whose symptoms improve enough to be eligible to be stepped down to a less intense level of care), and Second, patients with high risk flags improve faster than before (see the arrow to “Time to UnFlag” which affects the rate at which patients with high risk flags have those flags removed).
|| This causes more patients to become part of the “low symptom” group, so more patients can now both end their care and be recommended to step down to a lower level of care.  Back in the Stepped Care View, as more patients leave this setting, patient load drops even farther, and quality increases even more. When moving this direction, this type of reinforcing loop is often called a “virtuous circle.” However, this feedback loop also works in the opposite direction, where small increases in the number of patients in care can lead to lower quality, more patients staying with “high symptoms” longer, resulting in even higher patient load.  When this happens, this same loop is referred to as a “vicious circle,” or a “death spiral.” We have closed the loop, or brought our chain of causation full circle, and can now explain how this reinforcing loop of "Higher Care Quality Improves Recovery" could both energize our improvement efforts, or potentially derail them.
||**-- Work Pressure Delays Care Decisions Loop --**|
||In the Stepped Care View, start with Patient Load, which is the ratio of the total number of patients seen over the manageable total patients (i.e., demand over supply). One way that increasing patient load influences the team is the effect the team's ability to assess and develop effective treatment plans for each patients. If the team has fewer patients than before, then they have more time to focus on patients early in care, who still need to establish whether or not a patient is high symptom and start them on an effective treatment plan.  In the Measurement Base Care View, this effect directly impacts the variable "Time to Detect," where an increase in the Patient Load causes the Time to Detect to increase, and vice versa. There is no limit to the positive effect decreasing workload has on providers' ability to assess patients and develop effective treatment plans.
||This causes more patients to move through their care journey faster than before, so, all else being equal, more patients end treatment or step down to a lower level of care than before.  Back in the Stepped Care View, as more patients leave this setting, patient load drops even farther, and Time to Detect falls even more. When moving this direction, this type of reinforcing loop is often called a “virtuous circle.” However, this feedback loop also works in the opposite direction, where small increases in the number of patients in care can lead to higher Time to Detect, more patients staying in the "Early in Care” status longer, resulting in even higher patient load.  When this happens, this same loop is referred to as a “vicious circle,” or a “death spiral. We have closed the loop, or brought our chain of causation full circle, and can now explain how this reinforcing loop of "Work Pressure Delays Care Decisions " could both energize our improvement efforts, or potentially derail them.
||**-- Work Pressure Reduces Access Loop --**|
 || In the Stepped Care View, start with Patient Load, which is the ratio of the total number of patients seen over the manageable total patients (i.e., demand over supply). One way that decreasing patient load influences the team is the effect the team's ability to start new patients. If the team has fewer established patients than before, then they have more open slots on their schedule for new patients.  This effect directly impacts the "Total New Episode of Care Start Rate" ("Total" referring to the fact that this rate is all new episodes of care, regardless of where a patient is coming from).  This effect seeks to represent the physical reality of having a schedule based on a fixed team capacity, where the team can only offer so many hours per week.  There is no limit to the detrimental effect increasing workload has on start rate -- a high-enough Patient Load could cut new care episode starts to zero.
||Any initial increase in the episode of care start rate is quickly undone, as these new patients become established patients, and their recurring appointments fill up the more and more of the open slots on the schedule. The limiting factor of team capacity prevent this initial change from being sustained.  This is also true of a decrease in the start rate, as a team that starts fewer new patients but has the same number of patients leaving (either ending or stepping up/down) will soon have more open slots than they had before, allowing the start rate to increase.  A feedback loop that counter-acts change is called a "balancing loop," as any initial change will be washed out in the long run.  This type of loop is helpful in maintaining performance, but if ignored, can often lead to unstained improvement efforts.
||**-- Access Pressure Increases Patient Starts --**|
||In the Stepped Care View, start with "Patients Waiting to Start Care," which is the total number of patients who have been referred to this team, regardless of where they are coming from.  If there are more patients waiting than before, then the wait time to start with this team increases above the acceptable value (the "Desired Wait Time," which is estimated from the team's data), and the team feels more pressure to start these patients to bring wait times back down. The team will then start more new episodes of care than before to alleviate the high wait time, even if they don't have the capacity to effectively treat these patients.  This effect is limited to 2x, as even the highest increase in wait times could only double the original episode of care start rate.
|| As the team starts more episodes of care, the number of patients waiting drops, and the wait time falls back to the desired wait time.  This is also true if the team experiences a decrease in wait times, as the team would then start fewer new episodes of care than before, until the wait time rose back to the desired value.  A feedback loop that counter-acts change is called a "balancing loop," as any initial change will be washed out in the long run.  This type of loop is helpful in maintaining performance, but if ignored, can often lead to unstained improvement efforts.
||**-- Overwork and Burnout Reduce Care Quality --**|
||In the Stepped Care View, start with Patient Load, which is the ratio of the total number of patients seen over the manageable total patients (i.e., demand over supply). One way that increasing Patient Load influences the team is by increasing the team's fatigue. If the team experiences a sustained increase in fatigue, eventually the total patients the team can manage effectively decreases (as providers have less time for each patient, make more mistakes, and take more sick days). If sustained for long enough, high fatigue will cause burnout and providers leaving the team, which drastically reduces the number of patients the team can manage.
|| Unless something else changes in the team, as fatigue and burnout continue to build up, Patient Load will grow even more (the denominator is reduced, thus the ratio increases), forcing remaining providers to work even hard than before, and Manageable Total Patients falls even more. When moving this direction, this type of reinforcing loop is often called a “vicious circle,” or a “death spiral.”  Unfortunately, this systems story doesn't work the other way, as below-average workload cannot increase supply -- we assume that no individual provider will  book more appointments just because their team has fewer patients across their panels (shrinking numerator) or the team gets a new provider (growing denominator).  |
