### Session 06 Say Checklist

**Today we're modeling to learn how to tell a systems story.**

- [ ]  Hello! I'm __________ and I'm __________. Today we're modeling to learn how to tell a systems story.

**Navigate to the SEE guide to show Done and Do**

- [ ] [<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/done.png" height = "40" width = "40">](#DontClick)    Done: We logged in to mtl.how/sim_test and reviewed the "i" information in the Model Diagram and Experiments section.

**Emphasize team priority with the learning objectives on the screen**

**Learning Objectives for Session 6**

1. Describe the systems story of your team's highest priority.

2. Test out your thinking about causes of team challenges using the model diagram.

4. Apply clinical expertise to develop a question for team learning using simulation.

**Start in-session exercise and provide team-specific rationale for building capacity for participatory learning from simulation**

- [ ] [<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/illustrations/data_ui_sim_ui.png" height = "50" width = "150">](#DontClick) Provide rationale for building capacity for participatory learning from simulation.
- [ ] A Systems Story is a description of the causal connections that create the problem your team is prioritizing _________________.  

**Team lead shares Chrome and logs in to the Team world at **mtl.how/sim_test****

- [ ] **Re-size** your screen to get more or less of the diagram
- [ ] Select to continue with the **same module** 
- [ ] Navigate to the **experiment section** to pull up the **question** on the team need from last time.

**Introducing the Simulation User Interface Main Section with the Model Diagram in relation to team's priority**
[<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/>](#DontClick) _____________ **Time 00:20-00:30 - Team Priority**__________________ 

- [ ] **Experiment Timeline** Over what time frame does an experiment run? Two years from today.
- [ ] **Blue circle "i"** provide information on how model variables are calculated by simulation user interface, from the red variables that are read in from team data. The small circles with i inside throughout the sim UI provide additional information when you click on them. **Red circle "i" in the team data table** provide information for the red variables that are read in from team data. **"i" in the Experiments section** provide information on how the experimental variables are changing when you run the experiment.
- [ ] **Reveal complexity** shows more of the model diagram being shown but the model still accounts for all the complexity.
- [ ] **Red variables** are read in from team data.

**Introducing stocks/flows and polarities among key variables related to the team's priority**
[<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/>](#DontClick) _____________ **Time 00:30-00:40  - Team Priority**__________________

- [ ] The navy blue circles or gauges are always a **rate per week.** 
- [ ] The navy blue rectangles are **stocks** or states where patients or appointments accumulate.
- [ ] **Close the feedback loop** Trace the loop all the way around until we are back where we started.
- [ ] **Use Thumbs + plus** means two variables move in the same direction (both up/both down)-TEAM VARIABLES to EMPHASIZE ____________________________________________________
- [ ] **Use Thumbs - minus** means two variables move in opposite directions (1 thumb up, 1 thumb down)- TEAM PRIORITIES to EMPHASIZE ____________________________________________________

**Cover complexity reveal (causal loop) and base case question and dynamic hypothesis related to the team's priority** 
[<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/>](#DontClick) _____________ **Time 00:40-00:50 - Team Priority**__________________

- [ ] Cover the **basecase values** in the complexity reveal (causal loop) most relevant to the team's highest priority need.
- [ ] As you tell the story, **ENTER TEXT** about a **basecase question** and **dynamic hypothesis** in addition to the team need question. What do you expect will happen over the next two years if the team continues with business as usual? 
- [ ] **Save** (not Save & Reset) the text.

**Have Team Lead pull up the session 06 SEE guide Done/Do review.**
[<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/>](#DontClick) _____________ **Time 00:50-00:55**  

- [ ] Log into your individual world at mtl.how/sim_test and refine the Question and Hypothesis about the base case experimental run in the Text section.
- [ ] Log out of the SIM UI! 
- [ ] Team post session 06 email will be sent.
