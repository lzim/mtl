# Today we're modeling to learn how to test a dynamic hypothesis.
Hello! I'm __________ and I'm __________ [Co-facilitators introduce themselves]. Today we're modeling to learn how to test a dynamic hypothesis.

## Navigate to the SEE guide to show Done and Do
<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> _____________ **Time 00:00-00:05** 
- [ ] <img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/done.png" height = "40" width = "40">  **Done:** We logged in to mtl.how/sim and explored the results of the **Base Case (bc)** in the Expanded Outputs section to prepare for experiment 1. We reviewed our **hypothesis text** about the Base Case ___________________.
- [ ] <img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/do.png" height = "45" width = "45"> **Do:** We will **test a dynamic hypothesis** about ___________ **experiment 1,** comparing results against the bc in the MTL sim UI Outputs section.

## Emphasize team priority with the learning objectives on the screen
<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> _____________ **Time 00:05-00:10** 
- [ ] <img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/learning_objectives.png" height = "45" width = "45"> **Learning Objectives for Session 8**
1. Describe the systems story your team believes will cause the outcomes you expect to observe in your experiment.
2. Test your dynamic hypothesis about your team's clinical priority.
3. Apply systems thinking to describe your team's findings, insights and conclusions from your experiment.

## Team lead navigates using Chrome to log in to the Team world at **mtl.how/sim**
<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> _____________ **Time 00:10-00:15 - Team's Session 06 Question** __________________
- [ ] Join current session to pick up where the team left off in Session 07.
- [ ] Orient to "bc" in **Experiment Maintenance** on the home page: Including ability to **rename experiments,** if necessary.
- [ ] On **Main Page** team lead navigate to **Experiment Section** to **pull up previous experiment values & text** for **Session 07** about the basecase.

## Pull up **q/h/f/d** from session07 and ask **team lead** to review **team-specific** rationale for the **base case** findings
<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> _____________ **Time 00:15-00:20** - Team-specific **caual system story for findings** __________________
- [ ] <img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/illustrations/data_ui_sim_ui.png" height = "50" width = "150"> Provide rationale for **always comparing simulation experiments against the base case** of no new decisions.
- [ ] Review the **"d" decisions text** regarding the **team consensus** about **specific values** _______________ the team would like to experiment with today.    

## Bring session 07 "d" _decision_ text to be the _question_ text for experiment 1. Collapse and move Text to right, to use session 07 _causal complexity reveal (feedback loop)_ to revise _basecase_ hypothesis for experiment 1.
<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> _____________ **Time 00:20-00:25 - Team Priority Causal Loop**__________________   
**Specific Variables and Values from Priority Causal Loop**_______________
- [ ] Use the **causal system story** in the **model diagram complexity reveal for the team's priority** to "stake a claim" about what will happen over the next two years in the team if the **team's decisions reflect experiment 1** 
- [ ] Example question: "What happens to ____________ [**key output value from the team's priority**], over the next two years if our team **practice decisions follow __________________[experiment 1]**?"

## Move Text to left and refine/enter _specific values_ for experiment 1 in *hypothesis text* as you adjust sliders
<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> _____________ **Time 00:25-00:35  - Team Priority**__________________
- [ ] Example **experiment 1 hypothesis,** using specific **variables** and **values**: "If we **reduce the engagement duration** to 12 or 14 weeks in our team, then due to the **Feedback Loop: Balancing New and Existing Patients,** over the next two years, we will ___________." 
- [ ] Set all other **red** and **green** **experiment sliders** to **"bc" or "zero"** except **purple sesnitivity sliders**, which start with a default middle value of **"1"**.

## Run experiment 1
<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> _____________ **Time 00:35-00:40  - Team Priority**__________________
- [ ] Hit the **Green Run Button**!
- [ ] Go to the **Expanded Outputs** section and **Save** (without resetting) our run. 

## Compare **basecase** and **experiment 1** output charts of the _specific variables_ and _values_ related to the team's highest priority need ________________[output variable]
<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> _____________ **Time 00:40-00:50 - Team Priority**__________________
- [ ] Enter team **findings text** about the results for **variables related to their highest priority need**? 
- [ ] Describe how **Difference between Basecase and Experiment System Behavior** findings are explained by **Causal Loop Complexity Reveal** for team's priority in the *Our Findings* textbox
- [ ] **Decisions:** Based on what the team learned, what will the team **decide to do in clinical practice** (if anything) and/or decide to use _Modeling to Learn_ to learn next?

## Have Team Lead pull up the session 08 SEE guide Done/Do review.
<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> _____________ **Time 00:50-00:55**  
- [ ] Done: We **ran experiment 1** and **compared results against the bc,** and entered our Question, Hypothesis, Findings and Decision for Experiment 1 in the Text section.
- [ ] Do: Log into mtl.how/sim and Explore the bc and experiment 1, and draft a dynamic hypothesis to **prepare for experiment 2.**
- [ ] Demo for team how to **reload team's prior Question, Hypothesis, Findings and Decision text.** 
- [ ] Reminder to click "Save" and log out.
