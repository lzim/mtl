## Learning Objectives

1. Describe the systems story your team believes will cause the outcomes you expect to observe in your experiment.

2. Test your dynamic hypothesis about your team's clinical priority.

3. Apply systems thinking to describe your team's findings, insights and conclusions from your experiment. 


# In-session Exercise (30 minutes)

## Running an Experiment

1.	Log in to your individual or team world at [mtl.how/sim](http://mtl.how/sim).

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/gifs/mtl_2.0/sim_ui_1.gif)](#.)

**_MTL_ 2.0. For _MTL_ 1.7, click [here](https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/master/release_1.7/mtl_session09_see.md)** 

2.	Review your saved runs. Rename your saved runs if you feel you need to.

    + If you logged into your *individual world*, review your saved runs in the Experiment Maintenance section. 
    
3.	Review the data files you have uploaded for use and make sure you have what you want.

    + If you logged into your *individual world*, review the data files you have uploaded in the Team Data Menu Maintenance section.
    
4.	You can *Join Current Session* or *Start a New Session* in the Aggregate module. If you *Start a New Session* select the team data file you’d like to use.


5.	To refresh your memory and pick up where you left off last time, Select the experiment from the last session and check the box to include text from this session in Expanded Outputs text fields. Review those text fields.

**_MTL_ 2.0. For _MTL_ 1.7, click [here](https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/master/release_1.7/mtl_session09_see.md)** 

6.	Study the systems story on the model diagram and team data, and decide together what change you want to experiment with, that might give you the desired result.


7.	To create a new run building off of the previous one, revise the text in all the text boxes to reflect the experiment you want to do now: 

### Experiment 2
[<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_question.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/>](#.) **Our Question.** *Briefly describe what your team wants to learn from this experiment.* 

[<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_hypothesis.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/>](#.) **Our Hypothesis.** *Outline the systems story your team believes will cause the outcomes your team expects to observe.*

8.	Adjust experiment sliders for the new experiment, keeping in mind that the previous run’s settings are in effect.

9.	Run and then Save (without resetting). Name this run according to the variable setting(s) you changed.

10.	Compare Runs to see the difference the between base case and the current experimental run.

Record what you learned:

[<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_findings.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/>](#.) **Our Findings.** *Describe your team's findings, insights and conclusions from this experiment.*  

11.	Discuss and record what changes you may want to make in the clinic and what further experiments you want to run. 

[<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_decisions.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/>](#.) **Our Decisions.** *Based on what you learned in this experiment, what changes are you ready to make in your practice?*  

12. Save and Reset when ready.
