**Learning Objectives for Session 2**
1. Describe the decisions your team made in producing your team data.
2. Test out whether your expectations about team historical trends are displayed in the "viz" tabs.
3. Apply your clinical expertise to identify new information about a team patient in the "data" tabs.

**Participatory Learning from Simulation**
- [ ] Graphic: how *MTL* can help us to get more of our Veterans to the right care in the right time to meet their needs using participatory learning from simulation.
- [ ] We use the data user interface (UI) to:
	- look back at team trends over the past two years.
	- review the last two years of data to see *what is* in our team now.
		* Backward looking data review is limited for guiding effective change.
* Reviewing trends: may like or not like the trends; may not know what is causing those trends; may be afraid that the next change we might make will undo it. 
- [ ] Review use of sim UI – to look at team trends 2 years into the future to answer *what if* questions about different decisions the team could make.

- [ ] Confirm who will "drive" today [Recommend the Team Lead]

**1. On any browser, navigate to mtl.how/data.**
- [ ] Explain the Business Intelligence Service Line (or BISL) -- VA’s corporate data warehouse site.
	- You must have your PIV engaged to access the site.
- *Reminder:* BISL site contains Protected Health Information (PHI) - access is according to the permissions that are set up on your PIV.  
- We'll show you how files you pull from here will be saved back to the secure site, so that you can protect patient PHI just as you do in all your work.
- [ ] Select your VISN **______________**. 
- [ ] On the next page, select your team's facility **______________**.  
    - To open the file, do not click directly on the file name.
    - Instead, click on the 3 dots "..." next to the file, click "Edit", and click "Open in Excel".
    - By having the file open on your desktop, you will have smoother and better experience with the Facility as it is a large file.
    - Note: It may take some time to open and close the file since it contains 2 years worth of the facility's data.

**2. The Facility file is designed so see trends for the last two years relevant to your team vision of **__________________________**.  **

Let's explore the information available in the BISL sharepoint Facility file:  
- [ ] Have Team Lead review the three types of View options in the bottom tabs.

View | Displays 
-- | --
Count (in the Viz tab)| Count tables that match the viz graphs
Data | Sortable report of de-identified individual patient data
Viz | Visualization of trends over time

**There are four main data sets in the Facility file:**
[Facilitator – review rankings of the highest priority data categories to emphasize for this team.]

Rank | Data | Displays 
-- | -- | --
___ | Diag | Primary diagnoses only on visits in that setting level. (Note: In DataDiag, unique visits are shown, since each visit can only have on primary diagnosis. For more detail, open up the data UI).
___ | Enc| Encounter or visits types, such as medication management, psychotherapy, intakes etc.
___ | HF | Health Factors data related to visits, including evidence-based psychotherapy templates, and other clinical reminders and screenings.
___ | Meas| Standardized symptom scales, such as the PHQ-9 for depression or PCL-5 for PTSD, and suicide and behavioral risk flags

**To sum up, there are three ways to view each set of data:**

1. **Counts per month:** countDiag, countEnc, countHF, and countMeas;  
2. **Visual charts of trends over time:**  vizDiag, vizEnc, vizHF, and vizMeas 
3. **Drill down patient-level data:** dataDiag, dataHF, and dataMeas. 
         


<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> ___00:20-00:25___

**All data is sortable and filterable so that the team can transparently see how the charting you do all day becomes VA data.**

- [ ] 1. Last meeting ________________________ [team members' names] mentioned concerns with **__________________________ [themes from session 1 team vision].** 

- [ ] **What filtering options are available?** 
     
- [ ] 2. For each "viz" chart, filter on location and clinic name (upper left) to zoom in to the **clinic** or **VISTA clinic/"grid"**. 

- [ ] During intersession prep facilitator should fill-in the rankings of the highest priority viz that should be emphasized during the team meeting. Follow the team's lead "live" during the meeting, but be prepared.
   
Rank | viz Options |  |  
-- | -- | -- | 
___ | *vizDiag* | See trends in what types of diagnoses the facility/team is spending their time on (data are based on the primary diagnosis of each encounter, not the problem list for each patient).*
___ | *vizEnc* | See trends in what services the facility/team is spending their time providing.*
___ | *vizHF* | See trends in what specifics the facility/team's patients are getting in their encounters (in vis, this is a very long list.)
___ | *vizMeas* | See trends in what standard measures the facility is using on their patients.  Are they screening more for alcohol use disorder or depression or PTSD?*   
 ___ |*dataDiag* | can be sorted by primary diagnosis type based on icd10 code, to see more detail on what happens in any one diagnosis type*
 ___ |*dataHF* | can be sorted by health factor type, to see more detail on what happens in any one health factor type .*
 ___ |*dataMeas* | can be sorted by measurement type, to see more detail on what happens in any one measurement type.*

**To create a fresh data UI file, go through Steps #3-5. We will show you the steps but you already have a fresh data UI file.**

**3. Your Team Data Folder - Scroll to your team folder at the bottom of the page. Open the data_ui folder and open your data_ui file in Excel.**
 
**4. Go to the ClinicSelection tab.**

- [ ] Use columns C-H to select the clinics that make up your team. 
- [ ] Follow the instructions in **Box A2.**  
- [ ] Double-click on clinics to add them to column A, or you can highlight the clinics and click the gray "add all" button (Box B6) to add them to column A.  
 
**5. To view your team patient data and your team trends click on "Get-Patient-level Data".**

**You already have a fresh data UI file to work with in your data_ui folder. With your team lead (________), we selected the following clinics to represent your team.**   
-	It takes some time to stitch together a "hyper-local" query tailored to your team from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse,  may be up to 15 minutes.**
-	Prior to today's session, __________________ [Team Lead's name] worked with us to build an initial team dataset.**
-	Are there any adjustments that the team would make to the clinic selection criteria? For example, should we include trainees? Other considerations that seem important?

**6. Click to view the "viz" tabs, which show team trends. ** 

- [ ] Let's go to the **[__ ]** viz tab to see data relevant to that issue.  
- [ ] **"Quick Explore**" (look for the magnifying glass). In the **"Explore"** box, pick the item you want to explore and click on **"Drill To**". Keep using Quick Explore to drill until you reach the data you want. You can always click on the gray **"Reset Pivot Chart"** button to return to the original settings.

**7. Click to view the "data" tabs, which show your team's individual patient information.  **

- [ ]  Patients with restricted access to their information have asterisks (****) in Column F & G.  
- [ ] Patient information corresponds to the same categories as the team trends: diagnoses, encounters, health factor data (e.g., suicide plans, evidence-based practice templates), and measures from mental health assistant.  
- [ ] Providers can filter to find specific patients, or produce reports.

Keep an eye on time |  |  |   

- [ ] What **data** tab would you use to find out how many current patients on the team are engaged in a specific evidence-based psychotherapy? What column shows you the session number (EBP template) that the patient is on.  
- [ ] What **viz** tab would you use to see what the most common service encounters or visits are?  
- [ ] Are there services that have been **increasing over time?** 
- [ ] Are there services that have been **decreasing over time?**  

**That's it for *Modeling to Learn* how to check our patient data and team trends. Next is our Done/Do review.**
