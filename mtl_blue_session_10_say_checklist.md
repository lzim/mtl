**Learning Objectives for Session 10**

1. Describe the decisions you experimented with and how they are intertwined with other decisions and clinic outcomes over time. 

2. Test your understanding of the causal system story by describing what’s happening when it produces a system behavior over time. 

3. Apply your thinking to anticipate the short and long term trends in your team’s care quality under different decision scenarios. 

**Facilitator provides rationale: We've been _Modeling to Learn_ how to improve our use of systems thinking when making care decisions in our team.**

 - [ ] Show the Systems Thinking Table in the SEE guide.

Systems Thinking | Definition
-- | -- 
Complex | **Forest not trees.** Relationships among two or more **units** (patients, weeks), **variables** (_stocks_: patients waiting to start, _flows_: improvement rate), or two or more **settings** (primary care, general mental health).
Feedback | **Loop not line.** Not simple cause and effect. The end of   the story often influences the beginning, and is strengthened (**reinforcing**)   or reduced (**balancing**) around the loop.
System Behavior | **Movie not snapshot.** Trends over time. Systems _cause_ their own behavior through feedback.
Time | **Short and long term.** Better understanding of change over time (e.g., worse before better, better before worse, better before a lot better, worse before a lot worse).

**Team lead navigates using Chrome to log in to the Team world at **mtl.how/sim****

- [ ] Join current session to pick up where the team left off in Session 09.
- [ ] On **Main Page** team lead navigate to **Experiment Section** to **pull up previous experiment values & text** to review Experiment 2, and Experiment 1 as compared to the Base Case.

**Pull up q/h/f/d from session 09 and ask team lead to review the rationale for the relative differences among Experiment 2, Experiment 1, and the Base Case findings from the "Findings" Text**

_If you did not reset the Team World at the end of Session 9:_

- [ ] Log in to mtl.how/sim and join the current session, which should be at the end of the **Experiment 2.** 

_The advantage of starting **session 10** at the end of the Experiment 2 run in the Team World, is that you can compare the **system behaviors** of Experiment 2 (the current run) against both the Base Case (alternative 1) and Experiment 1 (alternative 2)._ 

**Review how the causal feedback explains why the simulated **team practice decisions** produce the specific **variables and values** produced in the system behaviors over time.**

- [ ] Minimize **Outputs and Text** and move the text to the **Right** to reveal the causal system diagram.  
- [ ] **Refine/edit Experiment 2 text** to capture the causal explanations for the differences between the Base Case, Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 entered for Hypothesis, Findings and Decisions.  

**Paste the Decision Text in the Question Box for Experiment 3.**

- [ ] Refine the text as necessary to reflect today's learning goal to combine the team decisions reflected in Experiment 1 and 2. 

**Use then causal system story in the model diagram to craft a Dynamic Hypothesis**

- [ ] Use the **causal system story** in the **model diagram complexity reveal for the team's priority** that explains the expected system behaviors that will be produced under the combined decisions reflected in Experiment 3. 
- [ ] Example question: "As compared to the Base Case, Experiment 1 and Experiment 2, what happens to ____________ [**key output value from the team's priority**], over the next two years if our team **practice decisions follow __________________[combined experiment 3]**?"

**Move Text to left and refine/enter _specific values_ for experiment 3 in *hypothesis text* as you adjust sliders and run experiment 3**

- [ ] **Specific variables and values for combined experiment 3 _______________ 
- [ ] Set all other **red** and **green** **experiment sliders** to **"bc" or "zero"** except **purple sensitivity sliders**, which start with a default middle value of **"1"**.
- [ ] Hit the **Green Run Button**!
- [ ] Go to the **Expanded Outputs** section and **Save** (without resetting) our run. 

**Use Systems Thinking to explain Combined Experiment 3 as compared to Base Case and Experiments 1 and 2 output charts of the _specific variables_ and _values_ related to the team's highest priority need ________________[output variable]**

- [ ] **Results Dashboard** review how the causal feedback explains why the **combined team practice decisions** produce the **relative differences in specific variables and values** produced in the system behaviors over time.
- [ ] Model for the team, and highlight the C.F.B.T. systems thinking concepts and add explanations in q/h/f/d text boxes.
- [ ] Dominant causal feedback that produces the system behaviors _______________ 
- [ ] Highest leverage (high yield) decisions that are most clinically feasible for the team to implement in their care _______________
- [ ] **Enter Decisions Text** to reflect **new practice decisions the team would like to consider next** and then click **Save** to save the text edits for Experiment 3.

**Have Team Lead pull up the session 09 SEE guide Done/Do review.**

- [ ] Done: We ran exp 3 and discussed the results using **C.F.B.T. systems thinking skills.**
- [ ] Do: Review and compare the bc, exp 1, exp 2 and exp 3 and think about possible new decisions team could make in their daily clinical care.
