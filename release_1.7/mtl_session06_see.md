## Learning Objectives

1. Describe the systems story of your team's highest priority. 
2. Test out your thinking about causes of team challenges using the model diagram.
3. Apply clinical expertise to develop a question for team learning using simulation.

# In-session Exercise (30 minutes)

* Purpose: The purpose for this activity is to familiarize MTL learners with the main section in the model diagram. By the end, learners should easily find information in the Sim UI.  

# **In-session Exercise – Part 1: Where in the MTL World Is…**  

* Facilitators will ask team members to find certain information on the mtl.how/sim main section.
+ Find the answer and “chat” it back to the Facilitator by typing your answer into the chat box.  
+ *If at any time you are not sure how to find something, ask for help.* The Facilitator will provide assistance by sending a hint or giving verbal support to all participants.  

1. Over what timeframe does an experiment run?  
2. Where do you find the descriptions for each variable in the module? Paste a portion of a description from one of the *Rates* into the chat box.  
3. Describe in one sentence what happens in the diagram as you click to Reveal Complexity.  
4. What is the significance of the variables in the red boxes?

# **In-session Exercise – Part 2: Telling a Systems Story**  

* Starting Point: Main model section with no additional complexities revealed.  

*Tip:* If you are not able to see the whole model diagram at once, try altering the size of the window using the browser's expand/reduce button and dragging the frame. The display will adjust to a stacked format that will get more of the diagram into one view.  

* Imagine a veteran in care. Tell the systems story told by the diagram in real-life terms.  
Make notes where you have questions or are unsure about the relationships depicted.
Describe the connection between the model diagram and the team data table. How are they linked?
