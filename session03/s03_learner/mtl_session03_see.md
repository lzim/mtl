## Learning Objectives

1. Describe your team trends over the last two years based on the estimates in the team data table.
2. Test out whether your understanding of how the team data is estimated through review of the descriptions and definitions.
3. Apply your clinical expertise to consider the team trends in the data UI and team data table to identify team priorities for learning.

# In-session Exercise (30 minutes)
<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/illustrations/data_ui_sim_ui.png">

### When you click the "Get Team Data Table for Sim UI" button, it produces a table of descriptive team data.
- Data are means, medians and percentages of key variables likely to influence the team's priorities for learning from *Modeling to Learn*
- There are team data produced for each module of *Modeling to Learn*
- Care Coordination (CC)
- Medication Management (MM)
- Psychotherapy (PSY)
- Aggregate team services (AGG)
- Measurement-based stepped care for suicide prevention (SP)

### 1. Select a service for review
- Find a variable that is important to you team. How is it estimated in this table? What are it's units?
- Where can you find even more detailed information about your team data?
- Check out columns C and D. What is the difference between these two columns?

### 2. Select a second service for review
- Check out columns C and D. What is the difference between these two columns?
- Find a variable that is important to you team. How is it estimated in this table? What are it's units?
- Where can you find even more detailed information about your team data?

### 3. Are there any team data table values you would like to explore in the team data UI?
- If so, which ones? Open the data UI to examine your question.

### 4. Does the team see any values in the team data that seem to vary significantly from expectations?
- If so, what is it surprising? Does the estimation definition help you to interpret the variable value?

### 5. Does the team see any values in the team data that fit your expectations about high priority team needs?
- If so, what are you noticing? In what ways does the team data fit with your day-to-day clinical practice in your team?
