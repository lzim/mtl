<p><strong>Learning Objectives</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Describe your own vision for what you would like your team to get from <em>Modeling to Learn</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Test out your thinking with your team about what your shared vision is for becoming a “dream team.”</p></li>
<li><p>Identify a shared team vision for learning from <em>Modeling to Learn</em>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>In-session Exercise (30 minutes)</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Prior Team Learning Prompt (5 minutes)</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Think of a good learning experience in your team. It can be in a meeting or an informal exchange with a colleague. It can be when you learned a clinic procedure, an idea for treatment with a difficult patient, or when a team member unlocked a mystery of CPRS for you. Try to think of a time when you had an ‘aha!’ or something finally made sense, or you could finally do something you couldn’t before.</p></li>
<li><p>Jot down on scratch paper what it was that made it a good learning experience. What were the characteristics of the experience? Compile a team list:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Most likely the following are true:*
<ul>
<li>The learning was hands-on and experiential.</li>
<li>The learning connected to the real world.</li>
<li>The learning experience was personally relevant, interesting, useful, or meaningful to the learner.</li>
<li>The learner had choices, shared authority, control, and responsibility.</li>
<li>The learner learned from and taught others.</li>
<li>The learner had the support he or she needed.</li>
<li>The learning was individualized. If there were standards for the work, the learner could meet them in his or her own way.</li>
<li>It was fun or left the learner feeling good.</li>
<li>The experience helped the learner understand him- or herself.</li>
<li>The learner experienced success and accomplishment with challenging work.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Best Case Scenario (5 minutes)</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Create team language for learning, aligning team decisions when there are roadblocks to consensus. Start by picturing Veteran mental health care in this team as you experience it now – the interactions/communications within the team in and out of team meetings; the key people you rely on outside the team; the information and data you use to coordinate care plans, and the feelings you associate with it.</p></li>
<li><p>Now picture the team learning over the next 6 months in a ‘best-case’ scenario, where things are happening in the team the way that you would ideally like them to. This is your “dream team” situation.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>3. Personal Vision (5 minutes)</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>What is team communication like?</p></li>
<li><p>How do team members relate to one another?</p></li>
<li><p>How is VA data used?</p></li>
<li><p>How are decisions, plans and changes made?</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>4. Review in Team (5 minutes)</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>What stands out to you?</p></li>
<li><p>Why did we choose these?</p></li>
<li><p>What makes them so relevant or important to us?</p></li>
<li><p>Can we address them all (bearing in mind our resources and time)?</p></li>
<li><p>If not, which would we most like to address (align around), and why?</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>5. Putting it Together (10 minutes)</strong></p>
<p>Overall “Modeling to Learn” objectives include activities and competencies that:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Are meaningful for you and align your learning goals with your team’s.</p></li>
<li><p>Develop systems thinking skills - help you see how several things fit together and understand causes that are hard to see without data and modeling resources.</p></li>
<li><p>Make VA data, initiatives and standards transparent to you.</p></li>
<li><p>Empower you to realize ongoing improvements in team quality of care and team quality of work life.</p></li>

<p>Throughout <em>Modeling to Learn</em>, we will start each session in our Learner See Guide at MTL.HOW, which is what we’re sharing on our screen now. We’ll review what was Done prior to the session and what we will Do in the session, as well as the specific MTL resources that we’ll be using.</p>
<p>In the Session 1 Done and Do table, you can see that for today, we logged in to mtl.how/live for screen-sharing during the team meeting and called in to the VANTS line for audio. Your home base is mtl.how for ALL of the tools and resources we’ll use in <em>Modeling to Learn</em>, so if you ever forget a link or VANTS number or anything, just type mtl.how into your browser.</p>
<p>Our DO for this session is to Launch <em>Modeling to Learn</em> and select a Team Vision for <em>MTL</em>.</p>

<p><strong>By the end of this session you will be able to:</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Describe your own vision for what you would like your team to get from <em>Modeling to Learn</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Test out your thinking with your team about what your shared vision is for becoming a “dream team.”</p></li>
<li><p>Identify a shared team vision for learning from <em>Modeling to Learn</em>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Let’s get started!</strong></p>
<p><strong>In-session Exercise (30 minutes): Team vision</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We learn best when we seek to accomplish things that matter to us. Today we will clarify what we are trying to accomplish together with <em>Modeling to Learn</em>. This learning process will be something you commit to because it reflects a key part your own vision for care in this team.</li>
<li>Identifying a shared purpose can be deeply motivating. We want to identify a shared purpose about what we are trying to achieve as a team participating in <em>Modeling to Learn</em>. The team learning goal provides the focus and energy for committing to learning together over the coming weeks. We have limited time, so we want to identify what is most central to team learning goals and connect this to daily team care delivery.</li>
<li>Team learning is all about ‘alignment’ and getting people working in sync with one another to meet the needs of our Veteran patients. We will explore “what is” (retrospective data) and vision forward to “what we would like it to be” (future-oriented).</li>
<li>The goal is to move from “my vision” to “our vision” and to shift the paradigm towards how things could be done with shared decision-making. Together, the clinic team lead and facilitation team will explore “What can be done better?” in a way that reflects common team aspirations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1. Prior Team Learning Prompt (5 minutes)</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>First, we want to set ground rules for our learning sessions. Think of a good learning experience in your team. It can be in a meeting or an informal exchange with a colleague. It can be when you learned a clinic procedure, an idea for treatment with a difficult patient, or when a team member unlocked a mystery of CPRS for you. Try to think of a time when you had an “aha!” Something finally made sense, or you could finally do something you couldn’t before.</p></li>
<li><p>Jot down on scratch paper what it was that made it a good learning experience. What were the characteristics of the experience? Compile a team list.</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><em>Most likely the following are true:</em>
<ul>
<li>The learning was hands-on and experiential.</li>
<li>The learning is connected to the real world.</li>
<li>The learning experience was personally relevant, interesting, useful, or meaningful to the learner.</li>
<li>The learner had choices, shared authority, control, and responsibility.</li>
<li>The learner learned from and taught others.</li>
<li>The learner had the support he or she needed.</li>
<li>The learning was individualized. If there were standards for the work, the learner could meet them in his or her own way.</li>
<li>It was fun or left the learner feeling good.</li>
<li>The experience helped the learner understand him- or herself.</li>
<li>The learner experienced success and accomplishment with challenging work.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Best Case Scenario (5 minutes)</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Now let’s envision our <em>Best Case Scenario</em>. It is important to create a team language for learning; for aligning team decisions when there are roadblocks to consensus. Start by picturing Veteran mental health care in this team as you experience it now. The interactions and communications within the team, in and out of team meetings. The key people you rely on outside the team. The information and data you use to coordinate care plans, and the feelings you associate with it.</p></li>
<li><p>Now picture the team learning over the next 6 months in a <em>best case</em> scenario, where things are happening in the team the way that you would ideally like them to. This is your <em>dream team</em> situation.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>3. Personal Vision (5 minutes)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Think about your Personal Vision for your team:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>What is team communication like?</p></li>
<li><p>How do team members relate to one another?</p></li>
<li><p>How is VA data used?</p></li>
<li><p>How are decisions, plans and changes made?</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Review in Team (5 minutes)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Reflecting as a team on those individual visions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>What stands out to you?</p></li>
<li><p>Why did we choose these?</p></li>
<li><p>What makes them so relevant or important to us?</p></li>
<li><p>Can we address them all (bearing in mind our resources and time)?</p></li>
<li><p>If not, which would we most like to address (align around), and why?</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Putting it Together (10 minutes)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Putting it all together, overall <em>Modeling to Learn</em> objectives include activities and competencies that:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Are meaningful for you and align your learning goals with your team.</p></li>
<li><p>Develop systems thinking skills that help you to see how several things fit together and understand causes that are hard to see without data and modeling resources.</p></li>
<li><p>Make VA data, initiatives and standards transparent to you.</p></li>
<li><p>Empower you to realize ongoing improvements in team quality of care and team quality of work life.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#DontLink"><img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/illustrations/data_ui_sim_ui.png?raw=true"></a></p>
<p><strong>6. Select the Team Vision</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>To wrap up, let’s home in on our Team Vision</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>You can further word-smith the Team Vision after the session if you want.</p></li>
<li><p>We’ll hold this vision up as a reminder of our shared goals to orient our learning throughout the <em>MTL</em> program.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>That’s it for <em>Modeling to Learn</em> how to align our team vision! Next is our Done/Do review</strong></p>

<p><strong>Participatory Learning from Simulation</strong></p>
<p>This graphic illustrates how <strong><em>Modeling to Learn</em></strong> can help us to get more of our Veterans to the right care in the right time to meet their needs using participatory learning from simulation.</p>
<ul>
<li>We use the data user interface (UI) to look back at team trends over the past two years.</li>
<li>We review the last two years of data to see <em>what is</em> in our team now.</li>
<li>Backward looking data review is limited for guiding effective change.</li>
<li>Even when we see trends that we like, we may not know what is causing those trends. And, we may be afraid that the next change we might make will undo it.</li>
<li>It is also really demotivating to see trends we don’t like, and not know what is causing the problem.</li>
<li>We will use the sim UI to look at team trends 2 years into the future to answer <em>what if</em> questions about different decisions the team could make. What we’re doing today is that <em>looking back</em> using the data UI.
<a href="#DontLink"><img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/illustrations/data_ui_sim_ui.png?raw=true"></a></li>
<li>Simulation helps us to place a better initial bet about what is likely to pay off for our local Veteran community in terms of getting patients timely access to our highest quality care.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In-Session Exercise</strong></p>

<p><strong>Who would like to “drive” today?</strong> (Recommend the Team Lead)</p>
<p><strong>1. </strong>Open an internet browser window. Go to mtl.how/data. First select your VISN and then select your facility.**</p>
<ul>
<li>This will take you to the VA’s corporate data warehouse site, the Business Intelligence Service Line (or BISL), where you will log in with your VA email and PIV passcode. This site contains Protected Health Information (PHI), so as a provider you will be granted access according to the permissions that are set up on your PIV.</li>
<li>We’ll be opening the <em>Modeling to Learn</em> data user interface (UI) in Excel from here today.</li>
<li>We’ll show you how files you pull from here will be saved back to the secure site, so that you can protect patient PHI just as you do in all your work.</li>
<li>On the landing page, select your VISN. On the next page, select your team’s facility.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Explore the facility data.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To <strong>view facility data</strong> click on the […] next to the file <strong>“facility.xlsb”</strong> and click <strong>“Edit”</strong> to open in Excel.</li>
<li><strong>Team files are in team folders.</strong> If you do not see a team folder, click on <strong>"Request New Team Folder</strong> in the horizontal header next the BISL logo.</li>
<li>The facility data is designed to show trends relevant to your team vision of for the last two years. Let’s explore the information available in the facility data Excel spreadsheet:</li>

<p><strong>If the data is not loading or showing incorrect facilities/clinics, here’s how to refresh.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To <strong>refresh your facility file’s data</strong>, right click on any tab at the bottom of the Excel spreadsheet and select <strong>“Unhide…”</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>“Unhide sheet:”</strong> dropdown, select <strong>“Control”</strong> and click <strong>“OK”</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>“Control”</strong> tab, select your VA facility’s station number in the <strong>“Station:”</strong> dropdown and click <strong>“Refresh”</strong>.
<ul>
<li>Do not worry if you see your <strong>Excel worksheet become unresponsive as the data is refreshing and will take about 1-2 minutes to complete</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>As a warning, Do NOT click on “Propagate”</strong> as this is used by our data team to update facility data across the nation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To create a fresh data UI file, go through Steps #3-5. We will show you the steps but you already have a fresh data UI file.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Scroll to your team folder at the bottom of the page. Open the data_ui folder and open your data_ui file in Excel.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you do not have a data_ui file or need a newly updated one, copy the file in the Master_DataUI folder. This has a master data_UI file that has already been pre-selected for your facility/station.</li>
<li>Click on the 3 dots […] next to the data_ui file.</li>
<li>Click on “Edit” to open in Excel, then click “Edit Workbook” at the top of the sheet.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Go to the ClinicSelection tab. Use columns C-H to select the clinics that make up your team.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This data_ui file has already been specified for your facility/station.</li>
<li>You can sort by Clinic Name, Division Name, Physical Location, Primary Stopcode, Secondary Stopcode, and Default Provider.</li>
<li>Note that this will pull all clinics used in the last two years, including de-activated clinics (denoted by a “ZZ” prefix). You can also see the de-activated clinic’s inactivation date in column I.</li>
<li>Follow the instructions in <strong>Box A2</strong>.</li>
<li>After filtering, you can double-click on clinics to add them to column A, or you can highlight the clinics and click the gray “add all” button (Cell B6) to add them to column A.</li>
<li>In the future, if you want to quickly get the same list of clinics again, you can select the grey “Get previous clinic list from last click of Get Patient-level Data” arrow in Column B (Cell B3).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. To view your team patient data and your team trends click “Get Patient-level Data.” We will not do this in-session today.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You already have a fresh data UI file to work with in your data_ui folder. With your team lead (________), we selected the following clinics to represent your team.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>To query patient and clinic level data using the data_ui, you will need LSV permissions.</strong> To check which facilities you have LSV access for, click the <a href="https://spsites.cdw.va.gov/sites/PBM_AD/_layouts/15/ReportServer/RSViewerPage.aspx?rv%3aRelativeReportUrl=/sites/PBM_AD/AnalyticsReports/LSVAccessVerification.rdl">link</a> to access the document through VA intranet.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>If you don’t have access to facilities that you believe you should, please verify:</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>CPRS access/permissions at your station (i.e COR tab access for CPRS).</li>
<li>Your network username recorded in VistA. To have your network username recording in VistA, please follow the instructions outlined in the <a href="https://vaww.dev.fre.cdw.va.gov/sites/D05_VISN21/DashboardDevelopment/Updating%20Network%20UserName%20in%20VistA.aspx">linked document</a> through VA intranet.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>It takes some time to stitch together a “hyper-local” query tailored to your team from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse.</p></li>
<li><p>On average (depending on the size of your team) it may take 15 minutes or so for your team data UI to pull in fresh data. And, Microsoft Excel will be unresponsive until the data UI has finished pulling in your data.</p></li>
<li><p>**Prior to today’s session, __________________ [Team Lead’s name] worked with us to build an initial team dataset.<br />
</p></li>
<li><p><strong>__________________ [Team Lead’s name], which column did we find most helpful for creating this team’s dataset?</strong><br />
</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Are there any adjustments that the team would make to the clinic selection criteria? For example, should we include trainees? Other considerations that seem important?</strong></p></li>
<li><p>We will look at the <strong>“Create Team Data Table”</strong> button and its associated tab <strong>“SPReferrals”</strong> next time.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Click to view the “viz” tabs, which show team trends.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Just like the facility data, there are team trends for diagnoses, encounters, health factor data (e.g., suicide plans, evidence-based practice templates), and measures from mental health assistant. Your team’s vision was about _______________. Let’s go to the _________________ viz tab to see data relevant to that issue.</p></li>
<li><p>You can further drill up/down in the “viz” tabs by right clicking on any trend line and clicking on <strong>“Quick Explore<strong>" (look for the magnifying glass). In the </strong>”Explore“** box, pick the item you want to explore and click on <strong>"Drill To</strong>”. Keep using Quick Explore to drill until you reach the data you want. You can always click on the gray </strong>“Reset Pivot Chart”** button to return to the original settings.</p></li>
<li><p>The viz tabs will also always return to default selections every time the team clicks on “Get Patient-level Data” to refresh data in their data_ui file.</p></li>
<li><p>Note: If you use the “Quick Explore” drill down using patient names, all of the asterisked patients will be grouped together.</p></li>
<li><p>You can also right click on the line in a trend visualization and filter to hide a selected item or keep only the selected item.</p></li>
<li><p>vizDiag in the data UI shows a drill down by diagnoses or combination of diagnoses. For example, the “PTSD” line is for patients with only PTSD. The “PTSD &amp; AUD” line is for patients with both these diagnoses but does not discriminate between which is the primary, secondary, etc. diagnoses.</p></li>
<li><p>dataDiag in the data UI has an additional column after “Diagnoses of Interest,” called “Primary Diagnoses”. “Diagnoses of Interest” retains all the current unordered diagnoses combinations, while “Primary Diagnoses” indicates what is the primary diagnosis. This means that if there is only one diagnosis in the “Diagnoses of Interest” column, it will still repeat what that diagnosis is in the “Primary Diagnoses” column.</p>

<p><strong>7. Click to view the “data” tabs, which show your team’s individual patient information.</strong>
- Patients who have requested restricted access to their information have asterisks (****) in Column F (dataDiag, dataHF) or Column E (dataMeas). If you are a VA provider, you can still identify patients from Column G (dataDiag, dataHF) or Column F (dataMeas).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Patient information corresponds to the same categories as the team trends: diagnoses, encounters, health factor data (e.g., suicide plans, evidence-based practice templates), and measures from mental health assistant.</p></li>
<li><p>Providers can filter to find specific patients, or produce reports.</p></li>

<li><p>Describe your team trends over the last two years based on the estimates in the team data table.</p></li>
<li><p>Test your understanding of how the team data are estimated by reviewing descriptions and definitions.</p></li>
<li><p>Apply your clinical expertise to consider the team trends in the data UI and team data table to identify team priorities for learning.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Let’s get started!</strong></p>
<p>As the graphic illustrates, we use the data UI to look back at team trends over the past two years - <em>what is</em>; and we will use the sim UI to look at team trends 2 years into the future to answer <em>what if</em> questions about different decisions the team could make.</p>
<p><strong>In-session Exercise (30 minutes): Team data table for simulation</strong></p>
<p><a href="#DontLink"><img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/illustrations/data_ui_sim_ui.png?raw=true"></a></p>
<p><strong>Navigate to the data UI at mtl.how/data.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You’ll log in with your VA credentials and you should have all the same permissions here as you do in general for your role in the VA.</li>
<li>Scroll down to your team folder. You should have two folders: data_ui and team_data_table. Click on the “data_ui” folder and open the Excel file.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Clicking the “Create Team Data Table” button produces a table of descriptive team data.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You already have a fresh Team Data Table file to work with in the team_data_table folder.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>It takes some time to generate a team data table for all modules using your team’s data.</p></li>
<li><p>On average (depending on the size of your team) it may take 15 minutes or so to generate a team data table. And, Microsoft Excel will be unresponsive until it is finished.</p></li>
<li><p>This is a different table from the one you generated last time by selecting the clinics that make up your team and then clicking “Get <em>Patient Level</em> Data.”</p></li>
<li><p>Data in this file are means, medians and percentages of key variables likely to influence the team’s priorities for learning from <em>Modeling to Learn</em>. Later on, we will upload this file to the sim UI so that it can <em>read in</em> these data, or parameters.</p></li>
<li><p>There are team data produced for each module of <em>Modeling to Learn</em>, each stored in its own tab:</p>
<ul>
<li>Care Coordination (CC) - tab title <em>CCParams</em></li>
<li>Medication Management (MM) - tab title <em>MMParams</em></li>
<li>Psychotherapy (PSY) - tab title <em>PSYParams</em></li>
<li>Aggregate mix of services (AGG) - tab title <em>AggParams</em></li>
<li>Measurement Based Stepped Care and Suicide Prevention (SP) - tab title <em>SPParams</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The patient cohort for each module is built by capturing all the unique patients who had a visit with the given team (from the user-supplied list of clinics/grids) within the correct encounter bin between 18 and 6 months ago. From that set of clinics, patients, and CPT codes, the data query then fetches all visits, no matter how long ago or how recent.</p>
<ul>
<li>In order to capture parameters that should be time-bound, such as new patients per week, the query can use that single year (e.g. from the patient cohort, how many were new to the team in the year that was used to build the cohort? Because that patient count captures all new patients over the year, we can just divide by 52 to get an average new patients per week).</li>
<li>For parameters that should not be time-bound, all the visits can be considered, so that some patients will correctly be fed into the model with many visits over years of engagement.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>We have already produced a team data table for you, but to do it yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select a set of clinics in <strong>ClinicSelection tab</strong> similar to what you did last session. In the future, you can pull up the same clinics used last time for creating the team data table by clicking on the gray “Get previous clinic list from Create Team Data Table file” button (Cell B4) to add them column A.</li>
<li>Additionally, if you want to produce team data for the <strong>SP module</strong>, click on the <strong>SPReferrals tab</strong>. Use this tab to select clinics that your team refers to/receives referrals from for the Suicide Prevention module. The data pull will track patients stepped up/down between your team and the one(s) you select. For example, if you are a GMH team, you would select “SMH” in the dropdown for “The clinics selected below that my team refers to are” and add the SMH clinics your team refers to in Column A. Once you have selected referral clinics in the <strong>SPReferrals tab</strong>, return to the “ClinicSelection” tab.</li>
<li>Click on the module drop-down. You can choose any module individually (CC, MM, PSY, AGG, SP), all modules without SP, or all modules including SP. If you are choosing “SP” or “all with SP”, make sure to do the previous steps using the <strong>SPReferrals tab</strong>.</li>
<li>Click on “Create Team Data Table”.</li>
<li>If you included SP in the module selection, three pop-ups will appear for the three possible care settings (GMH, SMH, PC/PCMHI) to indicate the threshold for minimum gap in patient care required for subsequent visit to be considered a new care episode. <em>In general for the (GMH or SMH or PC/PCMHI) setting, how long of a gap in patient care is required for the subsequent visit to be considered a new care episode? Set the threshold below in weeks. The default threshold is 39 weeks (9 months).</em></li>
<li>The team_data_table file you generate will automatically be saved into the team_data_table folder. Regardless of the module selection you make, the team_data_table file will include all five module tabs and labels, but will populate zeroes (“0”) for all parameters of modules that were <strong>not</strong> selected.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Navigate back to your team folder at mtl.how/data. Click on the “team_data_table” folder and open the Excel file to find the team data table already produced for you.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1. Select a module for review</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To show what data are used to tailor each <em>MTL</em> module to your team.
[Choose a module]<br />
</li>
<li><em>CCParams</em>: Key variables of interest in CC may include median engagement in weeks, appointment supply in appointments per week, return visit interval in weeks, starting rate in patients per week, and new patient wait times.</li>
<li><em>MMParams</em>: Key variables of interest in MM may include median engagement in weeks, appointment supply in appointments per week, return visit interval in weeks, starting rate in patients per week, and slots allocation percent for providers with and without an X waiver.</li>
<li><em>PSYParams</em>: Key variables that can be explored in PSY include median engagement duration and engagement after the patient’s first 3 months measured in weeks, appointment supply by service type (AUD, DEP, OUD, PTSD) within 3 months, and return visit interval after 3 months in weeks.</li>
<li><em>AggParams</em>: Key variables in AGG include median engagement in weeks, appointment supply by service type, return visit interval in weeks, new patient start rate (mean), and service proportions from team data.</li>
<li><em>SPParams</em>: In SP, key variables of interest may include high risk flag rates, engagement times before ending treatment in a specific setting, engagement time before stepping down or up between care settings, wait times, and the ratio of high to low symptom patients in each setting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out the different modules that are highlighted in the team data on the screen. As we review, we will use the mouse to highlight key team data variables.</p>
<ul>
<li>Find a variable that is important to your team. Look at how the variable is estimated in the table. Notice the units.</li>
<li>Where can you find even more detailed information about your team data? In each of these Params tabs, you can find more detailed information about your team data.</li>
<li>Check out the two columns to the right of the numerical data [show with mouse]. Let’s explore these two columns.
This column [highlight column] gives the description or definition of the variable.
This column [highlight column] contains additional details about how individual patient data are extracted and used to calculate your team’s historical trends.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Select a second module for review</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Check out the last 2 columns, to the right of the numerical data.
This column [highlight column] gives the description or definition of the variable.
This column [highlight column] contains additional details about how individual patient data are extracted and used to calculate your team’s historical trends.</li>
<li>Find a variable that is important to your team. How is it estimated in this table? What are its units?</li>
<li>Where can you find even more detailed information about your team data?
<ul>
<li>You can click on the “DataNotes” tab for a breakdown of how the patient cohort is defined, which CPT codes are used to define each service, and the patient engagement patterns (for the Psychotherapy module).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Are there any team data table values you would like to explore in the team data UI?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If so, which ones? Open the data UI to examine your question.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Does the team see any values in the team data that seem to vary significantly from expectations?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>If so, what is it surprising?</p></li>
<li><p>Does the estimation definition (second to last column, text in red) help you to interpret the variable value?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Does the team see any values in the team data that fit your expectations about high priority team needs?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>If so, what are you noticing?</p></li>
<li><p>In what ways does the team data fit with your day-to-day clinical practice in your team?</p></li>

<p><strong>Learning Objectives</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Describe the high priority needs reported across the team.</p></li>
<li><p>Test out how these needs are experienced across the team through team dialogue.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider the team vision and apply team decision-making to select a high-priority module of <em>MTL</em>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Let’s get started:</strong></p>
<p><strong>In-session Exercise (30 minutes)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Menu results and team needs discussion.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1. Complete the <em>MTL Menu</em> on your own.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you have not completed the MTL Menu at mtl.how/menu, please take 5 minutes to complete it. Your username is your VA email.</li>
<li>Once everyone on the team has completed the MTL Menu, and we will show the tabulated results <em>[Show Menu Results]</em>.</li>
<li>You will receive a summary of this in your follow-up email.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Review the team’s results with your team.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What stands out to you?</li>
<li>First we’ll scan through the results and see what stands out. <em>[Lead discussion; take notes.]</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Look for areas of consensus among the team.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What does the team agree about?</li>
<li>Where are there areas of high consensus? What issues does the team agree about?</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Decide which Menu results to show to reinforce consensus, based on relevance to the team’s priority needs and ability to assist us with our differential. Should be related to charts shown in Session 3.</em></p>
<p><strong>4. Discuss items in which team members varied a lot in their rankings.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Where does the team have more variable perspectives?</li>
<li>What are the topics where team members’ perspectives are more divergent?</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Decide which Menu results to show to discuss divergence, based on relevance to the team’s priority needs and ability to assist us with our differential. Should be related to charts shown in Session 3.</em></p>
<p><strong>5. Focus on the high priority needs to select a module for sessions 5-10 of <em>Modeling to Learn</em>.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What is the highest priority need for your team now?</li>
<li>Let’s think about which <em>Modeling to Learn</em> module best addresses that need. <em>[Recap the highest priority need, recommended module, and why.]</em></li>
</ul>
<p>There are currently 5 <em>MTL</em> modules available for teams to focus on in sessions 5 through 10:</p>
<ul>
<li>Care Coordination (CC)</li>
<li>Medication Management (MM)</li>
<li>Psychotherapy (PSY)</li>
<li>Aggregate mix of services (AGG)</li>
<li>Measurement-based stepped care and suicide prevention (SP)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What the models do:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>CC shows how a variety of team decisions interact to impact multiple outcomes at the same time. You can explore trade-offs between decisions such as desired new patient wait times, current patient return visit intervals, and overbooking, and how they affect team outcomes like total missed appointments, number of patients in care, and number of patients completing care.</li>
<li>MM enables you to experiment with how team decisions about referrals, time allocation, and visit frequency impact the quality of medication management for patients. Your team can explore scenarios to balance these tradeoffs and better meet the specific needs of patients with depression, alcohol use disorder and opioid use disorder. Insights you gain can help you increase local reach of evidence-based pharmacotherapies.</li>
<li>PSY shows how team psychotherapy decisions interact, and depicts patterns of psychotherapy engagement in your team. You can explore solutions to the challenges of getting patients to complete a full course of therapy, while also achieving goals to start enough new patients in psychotherapy. Insights about these dynamics can be used to increase the local reach of evidence-based psychotherapies.</li>
<li>AGG shows how a variety of team decisions interact to affect your overall mix of services. You can explore trade-offs between decisions such as desired new patient wait times, current patient return visit intervals, and overbooking, and how they affect team outcomes like total missed appointments, number of patients in care, and number of patients completing care. You can compare the effects of different decisions on outcomes in one service, or you can compare the effects of one decision on different services.</li>
<li>SP shows the effects of measurement based stepped care on patients’ symptoms and risk. It allows you to explore the impacts of implementing measurement based care to reduce delays in detecting patients at high risk for suicide, and to improve the quality of care by making better team decisions about when to step patients up to a higher level of care, or step them down to a lower level of care. It is also possible to experiment with team decisions related to new patient wait-times and access, the use of community care, and the impacts of provider overwork and burnout on the quality of care.</li>

<li>In Sessions 2 and 3 we used the data UI to look back at team trends over the past two years. That gave us a sense of <em>what IS</em> in our team now. For example, we saw that ___________________<br />
</li>
<li>Backward looking data review is limited for guiding effective change. Even when we see a trend we like, we may not know what is causing it, and we may worry that the next change we make will undo it. It can also be demotivating to see trends we don’t like and not know what’s causing the problem.<br />
</li>
<li>Today we’re at a turning point where we will begin to use the simulation UI to anticipate future trends. We’ll start asking <em>what if</em> questions about different decisions the team could make.<br />
</li>
<li>With the sim UI we have a way to test our hypotheses about those questions that lets us learn “as quick as we learn not to touch a hot stove”. And even more importantly, this virtual world lets us test our “what if” questions without any risk to the well-being of veterans.<br />

<span class="math display">\[ [&lt;img src = &quot;https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png&quot; height = &quot;15&quot; width = &quot;15&quot;&gt;](#DontClick) \]</span></p>
<p><strong>2. Let’s now go back to mtl.how/data in the browser window to check the name of our team_data_table file.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We want to grab the filename from there so we can upload it to the sim UI. Open a browser window and go to mtl.how/data.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. The team data file for simulation is in our team folder, in the team_data_table folder.</strong> <span class="math display">\[ [&lt;img src = &quot;https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png&quot; height = &quot;15&quot; width = &quot;15&quot;&gt;](#DontClick) \]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Navigate to the team_data_table folder and click the “dot-dot-dot” so you can copy the filename of your team_data_table.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Log in to the sim UI.</strong> <span class="math display">\[ [&lt;img src = &quot;https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png&quot; height = &quot;15&quot; width = &quot;15&quot;&gt;](#DontClick) \]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Open a new browser window in Google Chrome and go to mtl.how/sim. <strong>The <em>Modeling to Learn</em> simulation user interface does not work on Explorer. Please use Edge, Firefox, Chrome or Safari via desktop or mobile.</strong><br />
</li>
<li>Enter your login credentials - username is your VA email address and password should have been provided to your team in the Session 5 Pre email. Use all lowercase. If you forget your password, click on the red “Reset Password” at the bottom of the login section. An email will be sent to you to create a new password.<br />
</li>
<li>Click the down-arrow in the <em>Please select a World</em> pop-up. You see two options - one has “team” in it and the other has “ind” for “individual” in it. Since we’re working together now as a team, choose the team world. Any time the team is collaborating together at the same time, this is the world to choose. If you are exploring the sim UI on your own, it’s best to select your individual world so you don’t inadvertently change anything in the team’s world. You are welcome to log in to your individual world any time and play around. There is nothing you can break there!<br />
</li>
<li>An important thing to note is that this application has a responsive web design, so it adjusts the page layout to optimize to your screen’s dimensions. For example, if you use your browser control to reduce the window size, the sim UI will stack these sections vertically instead of showing them side by side. It will probably look like that if you are logged in on a smartphone. So just keep in mind that the sim UI may look different on different devices, but all the same functionality is still there.<br />
</li>
<li>If there is a critical issue that everyone needs to be alerted to, there will be a red “Alert” pop-up upon login, alerting everyone to the issue. These issues are our top priority to resolve due to their level of criticality. Once you dismiss this alert once, it will not reappear. Note, this alert will appear in both your team and individual worlds, so you will need to dismiss it twice.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Upon clicking buttons like the “Play” or “Run” icon, a quick tip will appear on the loading screen on different functions in the sim UI.</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. Orient yourself to the home page (Team name, navigation icons, player name, welcome text, sections with blue headers).</strong> <span class="math display">\[ [&lt;img src = &quot;https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png&quot; height = &quot;15&quot; width = &quot;15&quot;&gt;](#DontClick) \]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>At the top left is the <em>MTL</em> logo. That’s on each page, and it works as a Home button (just like the button next to it).<br />
</li>
<li>Scanning across that row you see your Team name followed by six navigation icons: Home, Play, Team, More Info, News, Report Bug, Tutor, and Logoff. These are pretty self-explanatory, but I would highlight the Logoff button. It’s best to log off when you’re finished with a session. At the far right along the top is your name and picture (if you’ve uploaded by clicking on the “Avatar” function).
<ul>
<li>Click on the “Team” icon to chat with your team or facilitator.<br />
</li>
<li>Click on the “More Info” icon for more info on the sim UI.<br />
</li>
<li>Click on the “News” icon for news flashes on discussion items. Your input on discussion items in the Community of Practice is appreciated. A red pop-up with a number will appear next to this icon (similar to how text messages work on your phone) to alert you to the number of un-read news flashes. Once you read the news flashes, the red pop-up will disappear, but you can always click on “News” to review the current new flashes.<br />
</li>
<li>Click on the “Report Bug” Icon in the top nav bar to report issues.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Never include any PII/PHI in your description and screenshot.</strong><br />
</li>
<li>To include screenshots, you can:
<ul>
<li>Copy &amp; paste from Snipping Tool<br />
</li>
<li>Drag &amp; drop a screenshot file<br />
</li>
<li>Upload your screenshot file<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Click on the “Tutor” icons for an “over the shoulder” orientation to the different icons, blue headers, and functions of each page. Each red tutor pop-up includes icons for:
<ul>
<li>Video: Links to the relevant TMS video for this section.<br />
</li>
<li>Guide: Links to the relevant session guide for this section.<br />
</li>
<li>Back/Next: Move back or next in the tutor instructions for this section.<br />
</li>
<li>Close: Close the tutor pop-up. Click on any tutor icon at any time, to get “over the shoulder” instructions for this section.<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Click on the “Community” button on the bottom right if:
<ul>
<li>You have an idea<br />
</li>
<li>You like something<br />
</li>
<li>You have a question:
<ul>

<li>Set up a GitHub account to ask your question directly in the Community of Practice.<br />
</li>
<li>Email your question to <a href="mailto:mtl.help@va.gov" class="email">mtl.help@va.gov</a><br />
</li>
</ul></li>

</li>
<li>To include screenshots in the “Community” button, you can:
<ul>
<li>Copy &amp; paste from Snipping Tool<br />
</li>
<li>Drag &amp; drop a screenshot file<br />
</li>
<li>Upload your screenshot file<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Below that row is the <em>MTL</em> welcome text, and under that there are 3 section headings in blue bars: Session; Experiment Maintenance; and Team Data Dropdown Maintenance. Whenever you see blue bars like these with a white triangle on the right, that means those sections can be expanded and collapsed by clicking on the bar.<br />
</li>
<li>If you’re not designated as a Team Lead, you won’t see all of these features. But everyone is the “Team Lead” for their individual world, so will see all of these sections when you’re logged in there.<br />
</li>
<li>We’ll be using the other two sections in a minute, but for now let’s expand the middle section and take a look. This is where you can manage the experiments you’ve run - you can delete, rename, or export them from here. Right now it’s empty, but it won’t be for long!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Start a New Session.</strong> <span class="math display">\[ [&lt;img src = &quot;https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png&quot; height = &quot;15&quot; width = &quot;15&quot;&gt;](#DontClick) \]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Start a New Session and review the sim UI Main Page.<br />
</li>
<li>Select the module your team decided to use.<br />
</li>
<li>Select the team data you just uploaded.<br />
</li>
<li>Click Play. (For the Care Coordination and Medication Management (CC &amp; MM) modules, after you click Play, you need to select your Learning Mode.)
<ul>
<li>If you are using a Learning Mode, refer to the Care Coordination (CCParams) or Medication Management (MMParams) tab of the Team Data Table at mtl.how/data, for data regarding the team’s New Patient Start Rates and Return-to-Clinic Intervals.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Note:</strong> Once you pick a Learning Mode to prioritize the New Patient Start Rate or the Existing Patients Return-to-Clinic Visit Interval, this will be the setting your team will experiment with through Session 12 for the rest of the <em>Modeling to Learn</em> program.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Existing Patient Return-to-Clinic Visit Interval:</strong> Choose this learning mode to prioritize the Existing Patients Return-to-Clinic Visit Interval (RVI) estimated from team data, and only start new patients in remaining open slots after the existing patient RVI, appointment supply, and missed appointments are all taken into account.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>New Patient Start Rate:</strong> Choose this learning mode to prioritize the New Patient Start Rate estimated from team data, and only see existing patients in remaining open slots after the new patient start rate, appointment supply, and missed appointments are all taken into account.<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Upon clicking icons like “Play,” “Run,” or "Reset,’ a quick tip will appear on the loading screen on different functions in the sim UI.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Orient yourself to the Main Page of the Sim UI (Notice the same information and buttons at top; 4 sections with blue header - one showing the module and team data selected in its header; the others headed Outputs and Text, Experiments, and Text).</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You see the same information and buttons across the top as the Home page.<br />
</li>
<li>There’s a new set of sections with blue headers below that. Let’s click inside the large blue header on the left to minimize that section, because we aren’t going to need it today. But notice inside that bar it tells you which module and team data file we selected.</li>
<li>To the right of the main section are 3 blue bars labeled Outputs and Text, Experiments, and Text. You can drag the Text section around by the blue bar. You can also expand, minimize, or close it with the icons on the top right side of the blue bar. Expand it to open up the Outputs section, including the Text boxes. Reduce it back to Text-only the same way you expanded it. If you close it with the X, you can get it back by going to the Outputs and Text section and selecting Expand.<br />
</li>
<li>You can use the app’s responsive design feature to enlarge the view. Use the magnifier (+/-) or the shortcut Control/Shift/+ (or minus) to make things bigger or smaller. At some point, the design layout changes to stacked sections instead of having them side by side. This is the way it will look on a smartphone screen, or sometimes with other types of monitors.<br />
</li>
<li>Record the team’s high-level learning Question.<br />
</li>
<li>Open and expand the Outputs and Text section if you need to.<br />
</li>
<li>Type your question about _________________________________ into the Question box.<br />
</li>
<li>Click Save. We will discuss naming more next time. For now, just click the down arrow at the first prompt and choose “bc” (stands for base case), and Add, then click the Save button at the top. (We do not want to “save and reset”.) Click Yes at the prompt.<br />
</li>
<li>Check out the Team Data Table.<br />
</li>
<li>“Exclamation points” in the Team Data Table for Measurement Based Stepped Care &amp; Suicide Prevention (SP): Sometimes we may have estimates derived from very few observations. We decided to set infrequently observed values to zero to avoid inflation of rarer episodes of care. Poor inferences are possible using estimates when the count is low and the duration is low. If the values are &lt;1% of the total counts of episodes of care in the team, and they are retained in the model, it will inflate rare episodes.
<ul>
<li>Exclamation points in the Team Data Table will indicate when a parameter is too low to be validly used.</li>
<li>The relevant red parameter values in the model diagram will have a corresponding exclamation point.</li>
<li>You will get a pop-up message from clicking on the exclamation point in either the Team Data Table or the Model Diagram to explain what is happening.</li>
<li>Our goal is to make the learners aware when low counts are used for estimates. A key systems insight for facilitators is that teams will always find the highest leverage change focusing on where the patients are (i.e., stocks or flows).
<ul>
<li>Here is an example competing for the same outflow of patients from PC/PCMHI:
<ul>
<li>PC/PCMHI to GMH: Episode count is 31 and duration is 30 weeks. This is most common step-up path.</li>
<li>PC/PCMHI to SMH: Episode count is 1 and duration is 14 weeks. This step-up engagement pattern was only observed once.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Because the flow is based on the engagement duration (weeks), this is an example of 30:1 difference in episode counts, but the difference in engagement duration is actually only 2:1 (30 weeks to 14 weeks). Retaining this parameter to estimate these model outflow (pts/wk) over the course of a two year experiment timeline would exaggerate the number of patients who step up from PC/PCMHI to SMH from 1 to 20 and reduce the number who step up from PC/PCMHI to GMH from 30 to 10.</li>
<li>If we set it to zero it won’t include this rare flow in the basecase. Because the outflow that is infrequently observed is set to zero, it will slightly inflate the other stock outflows, but this is better than extreme exaggeration of an uncommon episodes of care.</li>
<li>However, the Measurement Based Stepped Care for Suicide Prevention module includes low base rate patterns for high risk flag patients. The outflows from the HRF Patients stock are to residential. Sim UI - Setting View:
<ul>
<li>*PC/PCMHI - Residential, GMH or Unflag (3 outflows)</li>
<li>*GMH - Residential or Unflag (2 outflows) - likely to keep their HRF flag patients</li>
<li>SMH - Residential, GMH or Unflag (3 outflows) - no change</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Inpatient was not included as an outflow from any setting view because the patient never really transfer fully to the inpatient setting, they are still typically managed by the team coordinating their treatment before the inpatient stay and after discharge from an inpatient stay. The episode counts for HRF patients are always likely to represent a low percentage of the total episodes of care in the team.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>8. Expand the Experiments section and read the “i” information for the Team Data Table.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Open the section by clicking on the white down arrow in the right corner of the blue bar.<br />
</li>
<li>The data in this table come straight from the file we just uploaded. In fact, throughout the sim UI, we’ve used the convention that red font means “read in from team data”.<br />
</li>
<li>Click on the “i” in the red circle next to Team Data and read the “i” information. Throughout the Sim UI, we use “i” symbols for information pop-ups. Here, the “i” information is telling you how the data that you record, that you reviewed and chose in the data UI, are used to calculate or estimate the values in this Team Data Table.<br />
</li>
<li>What types of decisions does the team make that affect these variables?<br />
</li>
<li>Close the “i” information and look over the values - how do they strike you? Do they line up with how you think things are in your team? In particular, notice __________________________________________</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9. Find the Team Data Table variables in the system diagram at the left. </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>True Missed Appointments %<br />
</li>
<li>Appointment Supply<br />
</li>
<li>Return Visit Interval<br />
</li>
<li>Engagement Duration<br />
</li>
<li>New Patient Start Rate (AGG)</li>

Note: Once you pick a Learning Mode to prioritize the New Patient Start Rate or the Existing Patients Return-to-Clinic Visit Interval, this will be the setting your team will experiment with through Session 12 for the rest of the Modeling to Learn program.</p></li>
<li><p><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
Existing Patient Return-to-Clinic Visit Interval: Choose this learning mode to prioritize the Existing Patients Return-to-Clinic Visit Interval (RVI) estimated from team data, and only start new patients in remaining open slots after the existing patient RVI, appointment supply, and missed appointments are all taken into account.</p></li>
<li><p><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
New Patient Start Rate: Choose this learning mode to prioritize the New Patient Start Rate estimated from team data, and only see existing patients in remaining open slots after the new patient start rate, appointment supply, and missed appointments are all taken into account.

<ul>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
You see the same information and buttons across the top as the Home page.</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
There’s a new set of sections with blue headers below that. Let’s click inside the large blue header on the left to minimize that section, because we aren’t going to need it today. But notice inside that bar it tells you which module and team data file we selected.</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
To the right of the main section are 3 blue bars labeled Outputs and Text, Experiments, and Text.<ul>
<li>You can drag the Text section around by the blue bar. You can also expand, minimize, or close it with the icons on the top right side of the blue bar.</li>
<li>Expand it to open up the Outputs section, including the Text boxes. Reduce it back to Text-only the same way you expanded it.</li>
<li>If you close it with the X, you can get it back by going to the Outputs and Text section and selecting Expand.</li>

For next time, if you can, log in to to the sim UI at mtl.how/sim.</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
Remember that when you first enter your log-in credentials, you’ll be able to choose between your Team world and your Individual world. If you choose your Team world, it will already have a “session” started - because we did that today when we chose the module and selected the team data file that we had added. So you will choose Join Current Session and click Play.</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
If you’re ambitious to dig in and “play” in the sim, you can choose your Individual world and add the team data to the team data menu the same way we did just now. Then you can choose the module, select the data, and click Play. You can explore to your heart’s content in your Individual world without worrying that you’ll “break” anything or change anything for the rest of your team.</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
Whichever way you get to hitting Play from the Sim UI landing page, it will take you to the main page for the module. We encourage you to explore the interface more.</li>

<p><strong>The purpose for this activity is to familiarize you with the model diagram and how causal diagrams can be useful to understanding why problems arise and persist. By the end, you should be able to easily navigate it and find detailed information about each variable. This exercise has two parts, the first to practice navigating to your Team simulation world, and the second to use the diagram to help you tell your Systems Story. A Systems Story is a description of the causal connections that create the problem your team prioritized, _________________.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Let’s explore the MTL Home Page.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>To start this session, you should log in to your team world at <strong>mtl.how/sim</strong>, where you enter your username (email address) and password. After you click <strong>LOGIN</strong>, a pop-up box will appear with the text “Please select a World” on the blue bar. Select the world that ends with <strong>“team” from the drop-down menu</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you’re on the <em>MTL</em> Home Page, look over on the <strong>left section with Session in the blue heading bar</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Since we logged in to the Team World last time, you’ll see the <strong>name of the module and the dataset we chose under the first option</strong>, Join Current Session. Select that and hit Play.</p></li>
<li><p>Now check what you’re seeing against what we’re showing on the screen. It should have your TEAM name at the <strong>top left</strong>, and YOUR name and photo at the <strong>top right</strong>, and YOUR team’s dataset listed in the <strong>blue bar of the main section above the model diagram, here</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Also, depending on the size of your monitor and whether your browser window is full-screen or less, you might see more or less than what we’re showing of the model section. The model screen is a dynamic graphic, so the main model diagram will adjust if you re-size the browser window.</p>
<ul>
<li>On a PC, you can re-size your screen to get more or less of the diagram to show up at once by clicking the <strong>stacked boxes icon in the far top right</strong> of your computer screen.</li>
<li>On a MAC, to view the model in full screen click the <strong>green button in the upper left of the browser</strong> on your computer. To exit full screen, hover at the top of your computer screen, the toolbar will appear, click on “View”, click on “Exit Full Screen.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Navigate to Text section to pull up the Question from last time.</p></li>

<p><strong>In-Session Exercise - Part 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introducing the Simulation User Interface Main Section with the Model Diagram in relation to team’s priority.</strong></p>
<p><a href="#DontClick"><img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/></a> _____________ <strong>Time 00:20-00:30 - Team Priority</strong>__________________</p>
<p><strong>Now we’re ready to explore the simulation user interface main section with the model diagram in relation to your team.</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Over what time frame does an experiment run?</strong></p>
<p>See the box titled Experiment Timeline in the top corner of the diagram section. This shows the time frame over which an experiment will run. What is the maximum time into the future you can simulate? Two years from today.</p>
<p><strong>2. Where do you find the descriptions for each variable in the module? Paste a portion of a description from one of the Rates into the chat box.</strong></p>
<p>Notice the blue circle “i” in the diagram. These provide information on how model variables are calculated by the sim UI from the red variables that are read in from team data. The small circles with i inside throughout the sim UI provide additional information when you click on them. Red circle “i” in the team data table provides information for the red variables that are read in from team data. Circle “i” in the Experiments section provides information on what you’re changing when you adjust a variable to run an experiment.</p>
<p><strong>3. Describe in one sentence what happens in the model diagram as you “Reveal Complexity?”</strong></p>
<p>Inside the Experiment Timeline box you also see a set of options to Reveal Complexity. You can select check-boxes to bring more of the model diagram into view, or uncheck the boxes to make it less visually complex. The amount of detail showing in the model diagram does NOT affect your experiments; the model always accounts for all the complexity regardless of how much is being viewed at the time.</p>
<p><strong>4. What is the significance of the variables in the “red boxes”?</strong></p>
<p>In our convention, Red means read in from team data.</p>
<p><strong>In-Session Exercise - Part 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introducing stocks/flows and polarities among key variables related to the team’s priority.</strong></p>
<p><a href="#DontClick"><img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/></a> _____________ <strong>Time 00:30-00:40 - Team Priority</strong>__________________</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Starting Point: Main model section with no additional complexities revealed.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Tip:</em> If you are not able to see the whole model diagram at once, try altering the size of the window using the browser’s expand/reduce button and dragging the frame. The display will adjust to a stacked format that will get more of the diagram into one view.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Imagine a veteran in care. Tell the systems story told by the diagram in real-life terms. Make notes where you have questions or are unsure about the relationships depicted. Describe the connection between the model diagram and the team data table. How are they linked?</strong>
<ul>
<li>What are the main units <em>Modeling to Learn</em>?
<ul>
<li>Appointments/week</li>
<li>Patients/week</li>
<li>Episodes of Care (SP): Episodes of Care appears on the model diagram for Measurement Based Stepped Care and Suicide Prevention and in the Team Data Table. However, all of the Output charts are still in the units of appointments, appointments/week, patients, or patients/week.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Let’s do a quick orientation to the model diagram.
<ul>
<li>The navy blue circles or gauges are always a rate. The navy blue rectangles are patients or appointments.</li>
<li>In telling a systems story, we want to trace the loop all the way around until we are back where we started - so that we close the feedback loop and fully understand why behaviors happen in our clinics.</li>
<li>On the model diagram, you see plus and minus signs next to the blue lines. <strong>Use Thumbs to demonstrate +/- concept:</strong></li>
<li>If there is a plus sign between two variables, this means they move in the same direction (thumbs both up for increasing or both down for decreasing).
<ul>
<li>If there is a minus sign, the two variables move in opposite directions (1 thumb up, 1 thumb down; and reverse).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cover complexity reveal (causal loop) and base case question and dynamic hypothesis related to the team’s priority.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Walk-throughs of each loop in each module are included in a table below.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Enter a base case question and hypothesis in the Text section.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In the Question box, add a base case question about no new decisions in addition to the team need question that the team wrote last session.</li>
<li>In the Hypothesis box, briefly describe what you expect to happen over the next two years if the team continues with business as usual.</li>
<li>Click on the Save (not Save &amp; Reset) button in the upper right corner of the Text section. This will allow us to quickly pull it up at the next session.</li>

<td align="left">So, we’ll start this systems story with the <em>Referral Rate</em> - the green box. As a clinician you know that when <em>Referral Rates</em> increase, there is an increase in the back log of patients <em>Waiting to Start</em> a service, in this case CC. As the patients <em>Waiting to Start</em> increases, the average <em>New Patient Wait Time</em> starts to climb. Note the plus sign from <em>Waiting to Start</em> to <em>New Patient Wait Time</em> which indicates they will move in the same direction. So, if the patients <em>Waiting to Start</em> decreases, the <em>New Patient Wait Time</em> will decrease also. Let’s continue with the assumption that <em>New Patient Wait Time</em> is increasing. As this wait time increases, it increases the <em>Effect of Wait Time on Referrals</em> which decreases the <em>Referral Rate</em> so referrals to CC begin to slow down. Patients may be kept in or referred to other services so that they don’t have to wait longer than the desired or target wait time for their first CC appointment. In addition to running experiments around our Target Wait Time, this loop shows that we can also experiment with team decisions about Referral Rate. We can ask questions like, “If the Referral Rate to CC goes up by some percentage because we’ve started graduating patients more quickly from other services - but our Starting Rate in CC stays the same because we don’t have any extra appointment slots for new patients - what will become the ‘new normal’ for New Patient Wait Times in CC?”</td>

We hear a lot of clinicians say that good, ethical treatment is if you start a patient on medication assistance, the patient should come in for a monthly evaluation. If a clinician isn’t sure they can get a patient in for a monthly appointment, then they may decide not to start the patient on the service. For this activity of telling a systems story in the Med Management module, we would like to explore how our team can serve more patients with specific conditions, like Opioid Use Disorder (OUD), with our existing staffing levels.</td>

The <em>Effect of Wait Time on Referrals</em> is the difference between the <em>New Patient <strong>Actual</strong> Wait Time</em> and the team’s desired or <em>Target Wait Time</em>. In the Med Management module, we can adjust target wait times for different diagnostic patients. The “stacked” red boxes labeled <em>Target Wait Time</em> indicates you can change the target wait time by adjusting the red sliders read in from your team data for patients with Alcohol Use Disorder, Opioid Use Disorder, Depression and Other conditions. The effect of an increasing wait time on referrals, which has a negative sign, means a decrease to the <em>Referral Rate</em> so referrals to MM begin to slow down.

<td align="left">The Psychotherapy or PSY module shows how team psychotherapy decisions interact, and depicts patterns of psychotherapy engagement in your team. You can explore solutions to the challenges of getting patients to complete a full course of therapy, while also achieving goals to start enough new patients in psychotherapy. Insights about these dynamics can be used to increase the local reach of evidence-based psychotherapies. We’ll reveal the “Balancing Patients” detail in the PSY model diagram. Remember, if you’re not sure how a variable is defined, check the <em>i</em> descriptions on the model diagram or in the <em>Experiments</em> section. For this activity of telling a systems story, we want patients to complete a full course of PSY without decreasing the new patients that can start psychotherapy. So, if you as a clinician are totally full in your PSY slots, the only way you can start new patients is if patients quit or patients complete.

<td align="right"></td>
<td align="left">The <em>Reveal Complexity</em> detail for Balancing Patients shows the flow of patients and appointments in the PSY model. We see patients start psychotherapy and a certain number of patients get their first visit of PSY and end there; you can see this in the model here [use mouse to show “Patients in First Visit”]. We know that other patients will go on for additional visits. In the model diagram, we can explore data for patients who attend 2 to 7 visits [use mouse to show “Patients in Visit 2 to 7”] but they haven’t yet completed a full course of PSY. Next, there is a subset of patients will go on to achieve 7 or more visits in their own first 3 months. Some will graduate and some will continue treatment after 3 months. Obviously our team wants patients to complete a full course of PSY without decreasing the new patients that can start.</td>

Remember, we follow the blue line upward to <em>Booking Rate</em> and there is a plus <em>+</em> sign which means the Starting Rate and Booking Rate move in the same direction. As the <em>Booking Rate</em> increases, this increases the appointments on the books for PSY [use mouse to show booking rate to appointments in PSY]. As the overall appointment supply goes up it can increase the overall appointments for new patients or existing patients. So, as the <em>Appointments in Psychotherapy</em> increases, we follow the light blue arrow to <em>Appointments for Existing Patients</em> and see that plus <em>+</em> sign indicating an increase in appointments on the books for existing patients. As the appointments for existing patients goes up, it decreases the appointments for new patients, as this goes down it decreases the <em>Starting rate</em> as shown with the long blue arrow down the left side of the screen that connects <em>Additional Appointments Available to New Patients</em> to <em>Starting Rate</em> with a plus <em>+</em> sign.</td>

If you click through the services listed under <em>Display Patient Services</em> you will see the numbers change in the dark blue circles and rectangles in the model diagram. This represents the our team’s appointments and patients data for each service. Remember, if you’re not sure how a variable is defined, check the <em>i</em> descriptions on the model diagram or in the <em>Experiments</em> section. Let’s show the “RVI and Wait Times” under <em>Reveal Complexity</em> in the AGG model. Our team is going to be losing two staff members in the near future. Since the aggregate module shows the interactions between all services offered by our team, we want to use this module to explore how we can best allocate appointments across services with reduced staffing levels. We also want to know what will happen to patient wait times if we change patient return-to-clinic visit intervals (RVI) and/or if the remaining staff members decide to work overtime or not.</td>

Let’s start In the Appointments section of the diagram with the <em>Booking Rate</em>. As the <em>Booking Rate</em> goes up, the <em>Appointments</em> increase. If there are more patients who need an appointment then there are appointments or clinical hours available, clinicians may feel work pressure. This is the light blue arrow with the plus <em>+</em> sign leading from <em>Appointments</em> to <em>Work Pressure</em>.</td>

<td align="left">When a clinic team experiences increasing <em>Work Pressure</em> then there is an <em>Effect of Work Pressure on Scheduled Return Visit INterval</em> such that as work pressure increases, there is an increases the time between appointments or the <em>Return to Clinic Visit Interval</em>. As the <em>Return to Visit Interval</em> increases the <em>Booking Rate</em> decreases, you can tell this by the negative sign at the end of the light blue arrow leading from RVI to Booking Rate. Thus, the balancing loop is <em>Appointment Backlog Extends Return Visit Interval</em> is complete.</td>

This effect directly impacts the “Total New Episode of Care Start Rate” (“Total” referring to the fact that this rate is all new episodes of care, regardless of where a patient is coming from). This effect seeks to represent the physical reality of having a schedule based on a fixed team capacity, where the team can only offer so many hours per week.

<p><strong>2. Join Current Session to pick up where the team left off.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Orient yourself to the main page: Team Name (when you’re in your individual world, the team name is your name); selected module (CC, MM, PSY, AGG, or SP); selected data file. All slider settings in the Experiments section are at Base Case or default values.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>“In the last session, you all created a question about your team’s top improvement priority and the Systems Story that surrounds that issue. Today we’re going to make that story come alive – we are going to run a simulation, and see the impact of these system causes over the next two years, as as function of our local capacities and constrains, as estimated with our local data.

</ul>
<p><a href="#."><img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_question.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/></a> <strong>Example Question to add:</strong> What happens to ______________ (from the team’s priority) if we make no new decisions?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There is important research showing that is not likely to improve learning to click around and run experiments without stating what you <em>expect</em> will happen over the next two years before you run the simulation.</p></li>
<li><p>In order to benefit from experiential simulation learning, you need to create a hypothesis – an if/then statement about what you believe will happen over the next two years as a consequence of your change. Through this process you can be surprised, have some things confirmed, but perhaps also find that when more variables and complexity are accounted for, there may be counter-intuitive findings too.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Expand the Outputs and Text section and enter text in the boxes to reflect your question and hypothesis about a base case run – one where no new decisions are made in your team, and run the simulation out to its 2-year end just using data pulled in from your team data file.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Add</strong> your hypothesis about the base case run results in the <em>Our Hypothesis</em> text box. Reference team data value relevant to the team’s question. We want to be as specific as possible, and we have the question, hypothesis, findings and decisions boxes here, which the teams can use as a lab notebook to track their thinking. They can then save their work, so that they can efficiently pick up where they left off, which is critical when time for team huddles in the clinic is very tight.</li>

<ul>
<li>Helpful tip: To run the Base Case, let’s first make sure that all the Experiment sliders are indeed set for the Base Case. When you look in the Experiments section, you should see that the box next to each slider says either zero or bc. If it says bc, it means the value the model will run is the number from the Team Data Table. A few sliders have a different setting. If you see a purple Sensitivity slider, it will start at a default value of 1, which is the mid-range, between no relationship between those two variables, and a very strong relationship. (And if there’s a Team Data vs Balanced switch, Balanced will be the default setting.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Run, then Save (without resetting) the run with the name Base Case.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Once we’ve verified that sliders are set for the Base Case and we’ve entered our question and hypothesis, we’re ready to hit <strong>Run</strong>. (drum roll!)</p></li>
<li><p>Now let’s open the Outputs section and see what we find. The quick way to do this is to click the “expand” button in the blue bar of the Texts section.</p></li>
<li><p>This opens the full Outputs and Text section, which now shows all the Text boxes and a larger Results Dashboard where you can see several charts at once, and a Control Panel on the left.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Before we go further, it’s a good time to go ahead and Save this run.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Saving without Resetting will capture the text that we’ve written in the boxes and the settings and results of our run. We’ll still be able to enter more text to finish our consideration of this test as long as we don’t re-set the sim.</p></li>
<li><p>So, click on <em>Save</em> at the top and then click <em>Yes</em>. This warning is just a reminder of how important it is to record your thinking in the Text boxes so your learning from what you’ve done doesn’t evaporate.</p></li>
<li><p>The Save menu helps you enter a name for each run based on what sliders you moved. In this case, it’s the Base Case, so on the Variable drop-down menu just select Base Case and click <em>Add</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>You’ll see “bc” entered in the Experiment Name field and now you can click <em>Save</em> again in the top right.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Caution</strong>: Only choose the <em>Save and Reset</em> button at the bottom when you’re finished recording all you need to in the Text section. Or you can choose <em>Discard</em> if you weren’t ready to save or name the run.</p></li>

If the start rate is lower than the data suggest, then the team could be facing more hurdles than we can see in the data, are seeing patients for longer, or perhaps the 75th percentile we’re using to estimate their appointment supply is too optimistic.</td>

Example: Based on the Sankey diagram, we understand that out of N=371 patients who have one PSY visit, n=289 are Initiators. Of these, only n=107 are Completers, and of Completers, on n=4 graduate after having an evidence-based dose of PSY (about 8 sessions in their first three months with the team). Patients who remain in care after their first three months take up the majority of slots, with patients who only get one visit in their first 3 months eventually taking 6 more visits before ending (thus never receiving a complete dose), and patients who complete but return taking 26 visits before ending (double the evidence base).</td>

If we look over to the Team Data Table, we can see that these patients are waiting an average of 28 weeks before starting treatment there. Now, if we minimize the table [CLICK ON THE RED ARROW] and open up “GMH Patients and Patients Waiting to Start,” we can see how many patients total are in care. Click on the “BC” button in “Manageable Total Patients” to see that we have 517 patients in care. Care quality does not improve (specifically, the team’s main concern of wait time to step up). However, if our manageable patient load stays the same over the next two years at the past two years, we shouldn’t expect things to get worse, either.</td>

We expect that we will be able to both develop treatment plans faster and improve patients symptoms faster if we continually track their symptoms, hopefully engaging the “Higher Care Quality Improves Recovery” cycle.</td>

<p><strong>Running an experiment</strong></p>
<p>Providers know there are a lot of interdependencies that make improving care in the clinic challenging. Often, because we’re embedded in such a large care system, we may be “flying blind” with regard to how our own care decisions fit within all that is going on locally. We can use simulation to help reveal the connections and figure out which changes work, which don’t, and which are sustainable, a lot faster and safer than in the real world.</p>

<li><p>Click on ____________ under “reveal complexity” to see the systems story relevant to the experiment you decided on in the last session.</p></li>
<li><p>In the diagram, the rectangles that look like the levels of gas that you have in your gas tank are showing states in care where patients or appointments can accumulate or drop. For example, in this team we see ___ patients in the ________ stock. The number of patients in a state are influenced by flow rates - designated by circles here that look like speedometers. For example, this ______ rate shows that about ___ patients per week in this team move from _________ to _________ <span class="math display">\[show with mouse work\]</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First, explore the Appointments section of the diagram and see how Appointment Supply links to a number of variables.</p></li>
<li><p>Then, examine the Patients section and notice how the different gauges and rectangles are linked and what causes them to increase or decrease.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally see how the Patients and Appointments interact with each other, for example, by examining appointment supply and return visit interval. Remember, red means values that are read into the model from your team data.</p></li>
<li><p>As a team, you decide what change to experiment with in the sim. To make that decision, you should ask: 1) How do we think things will change over time if make a specific change?; and 2) What relationships in the system will interact if we make that change? Ultimately, the team should choose changes that might give the desired result, based on the team vision and team need.</p>

<p><strong>7. To create a new run building off of the previous one, revise the text in all the text boxes to reflect the experiment you want to do now.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Let’s create a new experiment building off of the previous one, the base case of no new decisions. The important thing for learning is to stake a claim about your expectations, so the simulation output can teach you something. This process can also help teams to reconcile differences and achieve consensus about ways to move forward and take action for improvement. You all probably won’t agree about what the likely impact of any change will be, but we can use Modeling to Learn engage in participatory learning to find out.</p></li>
<li><p>The first step is to revise the text in all the text boxes to reflect the experiment you want to do now:</p>
<p><a href="#."><img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_question.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/></a> <a href="#."><img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_hypothesis.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/></a> <strong>Example Questions and Hypotheses:</strong> <em>Briefly describe what your team wants to learn from this experiment and outline the systems story your team believes will cause the outcomes your team expects to observe.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>CC</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Q: What will happen to the Starting Rate and New Patient Wait Time if we increase the Appointment Supply of care coordination appointments overall?</li>
<li>H: Increasing the CC Appointment Supply will make more Appointments available for both new and existing CC patients. The Additional Appointment Supply for New CC Patients will increase the Starting Rate and lower New Patient Wait Times.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>MM</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Q: How could we serve more patients with specific conditions, like OUD, with our existing staffing levels?</li>
<li>H: If our referral rate for OUD is 2 pts per month (0.5 per week), and we allocate 40% of our x-waiver slots to OUD treatment, and 40% to Other Needs, and we change our RVI for depression to 12 weeks, and the RVI for OUD to 4 weeks (in line with our quality standards), then we will serve more OUD patients with our existing team staff, without increasing the wait time for new depression patients.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>PSY</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Q: What if we graduate more patients who complete 8 or more psychotherapy sessions in their first 3 months? What is the effect of working to increase the proportion of patients who ‘complete’ an evidence-based dose of PSY and then graduate from just 4% to 75%, over time, on (1) the number of patients who complete and are then ‘done’? and (2) on the supply of available appts for new patients?</li>
<li>H: We expect that if we increase our completers who graduate to 75%, then we’ll free up more slots in the clinic for more patients to start psychotherapy/EBPsy. We hypothesize that increasing the complete and graduate rate from 4% to 75% will result in a jump from about 4 patients to about 75 patients graduating during the same time period. We also expect that by increasing the graduation rate for any one who has received 8 or more sessions of PSY, we will increase the number of appt slots for new patients starting PSY.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>AGG</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Q: How can we manage the loss of two providers and still manage patient needs for PSY? What would happen if we change the PSY RVI to 2 weeks and the RVI for EB PSY to just 1 week (from 17 weeks)?</li>
<li>H: We expect to see the number of PSY patients in service to go down within the first year, and then to reach a new level that is well below 300. If the numbers were down to 150 patients, then we may be able to handle the staff reduction.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>SP</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Q: How much does implementing Measurement Based Care improve our ability to get our high symptom patients into the right care at the right time? How will this change in our team impact the other settings in Mental Health? Will it kick off a virtuous cycle of GMH care quality improving recovery?</li>
<li>H: If we more readily detect patients’ symptoms and risk, then our improvement rate will increase, moving more patients in to recovery. For this team, with their local resources and constraints, can more patients graduate from general mental health care, our patient load will drop and open more slots to start new care episodes. If we implement measurement based care in our GMH team, then care quality will improve (specifically through reductions in Time to Improve and Time to UnFlag, and an increase in the Time to Ending). Also, how long it takes clinicians to see changes in their patients will also improve (seen in a reduction in Time to Detect). We expect to be able to effectively diagnose and treat patients faster, reducing the number of high-symptom patients in care, and thus reducing the number of patients who receive high risk flags. However, low symptom patients are in care for longer than before, reducing the number of openings for new patients. These patients will make up more and more of our total – as there will be both more flowing in (due to higher Improvement Rate) and fewer flowing out (due to the lower Ending Rate). With fewer openings, wait times to start with our team should increase.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>8. Adjust experiment sliders for the new experiment, keeping in mind that the previous run’s settings are in effect (for this session that just means the base case or default values).</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Slide the Text box to the left, over the model section. This will allow you to adjust experiment sliders for the new experiment.</p></li>
<li><p>In the experiments section we also have experimental sliders with “i” information that tells you what you’re changing when you adjust that slider in your experiment.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep in mind that the previous run’s settings are in effect – in this case, we have only run the bc or base case so the default values from the team data are the previous run settings.</p></li>
<li><p>A quick tip – make note of the service or services you selected to change and the new values, that is, what you changed the numbers to, so you have that information available for naming the experiment when you save it.</p>

<li><p>As you describe the findings, record what you observe and learn in the <em>Our Findings</em> text box:</p>
<p>___Example of chart review for SP:___</p></li>
<li><p>In our last session, based on the team’s needs assessment, we focused on the team’s issue with long wait times stepping patients up from GMH to SMH when needed. In the bottom middle panel we can see that implementing MBC in our GMH team is likely to reduce the wait Time to Step up to SMH from approximately 45 weeks to 32 weeks over the next two years. I’ll use my mouse and click the down arrow to show you the full variable name, which is highlighted in blue. This reduction in wait times for stepping patients up to Specialty Mental Health is due to the reduction in high symptom patients over the next two years.</p></li>
<li><p>We can see this by looking at the upper middle and upper right panels, which show how implementing MBC will improve GMH care quality: As the improvement rate increases, the ratio of high to low symptom patient decreases, fewer patients receive a high risk flag and wait times to step up to SMH decrease.</p></li>
<li><p>However, looking at the graph in the upper left corner, patient load stays the same in our MBC experiment as it was in the base case – something prevents our virtuous cycle. The virtuous cycle of our reinforcing feedback, “Higher care quality improves recovery,” depends on the team getting patients better and moving them on from GMH.</p></li>
<li><p>As result of our experiment, although wait times to step up form GMH to SMH go down, the lower left and right graphs show that wait times to step down to PC/PCMHI increase, and GMH patients waiting to start increases over the next two years.</p></li>
<li><p>To summarize, yes, more of our patients are stabilizing and able to be stepped down to PC. But, we aren’t stepping them all down to PC because PC hasn’t made any new decisions in this experiment and hasn’t implemented any strategies to take on our patients. This causes longer wait times to step GMH patients down, which further reduces the number of patients the GMH team will recommend should step down for care. As we can see in the bottom left graph, the black line for our current MBC experiment shows that improvements in GMH quality due to implementing Measurement Based Care without coordinating this change with primary care will lead to increased wait-times for stepped down, and lead to the undesirable effect of patients waiting to start care in GMH as our stabilized patients build up in our GMH clinic.</p></li>
<li><p>Thus, low symptom patients build up in our clinics. Also, PC is taking more patients than they can handle, so their quality declines, and GMH gets more patients stepping up from PC –&gt; demand for GMH goes up! Something that we think is outside of our control is actually a result of our own decision.</p>
<p><a href="#."><img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_findings.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/></a> <strong>Example Findings:</strong> <em>Describe your team’s findings, insights and conclusions from this experiment.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>CC</strong> - Increasing the supply of Appointment Supply for New CC Patients does increase the new CC patient weekly Starting Rate, which reduces new CC patients Waiting to Start.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MM</strong> - We found that if we allocate 50% of our x-waiver provider appointments to OUD, in the long run instead of only starting ½ patient per week (1 every other week), we can start 3 patients in OUD per week. But dropping the appointment supply for our <em>Other</em> patients meant we could not start any of them in care for a while until some existing patients completed and moved on. A backlog built up, which caused referrals to slow. When we were eventually able to start <em>Other</em> patients, the backlog dropped so referrals picked up again, and we established a new steady state with about 15 <em>Other</em> diagnosis patients waiting to start and about 170 in care.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>PSY</strong> - We found that the total number of patients served by the team increased from N=371 to N=460. Of the 460, n=358 were Initiators and n=132 were Completers. Among Completers, n=99 graduated and were done (75%, as we expected). Regarding the starting rate for new patients, it increased from about 3.8 pts/wk to about 4.8 pts/wk. our hypotheses was supported. This dramatically increases the number of patients in PSY who are receiving an evidence base dose of therapy and supports the team in taking on more new patients, about one more new pt/wk (or 4 new ones per month, or 48 new ones annually!).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>AGG</strong> - Our hypothesis was supported! We see that implementing a much shorter RVI for PSY patients show a steady reduction in the number of PSY patients in service, from more than 300 in our bc to less than a 100 after two years. Booking rates for PSY climb initially, but then drop off and level out just a bit higher than baseline! One concern is that MM patients in service also drops from about 1000 to 900.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>SP</strong> - As predicted, we see a dramatic shift in patient from “high symptom” to “low symptom,” as both detection and care quality improve – the ratio of high to low symptom patients drops from 0.6:1 to 0.2:1 over two years. The number of patients with a suicide flag decreases by more than 50%, as more high symptom patients have their symptoms addressed before they can be flagged in the first place. However, the initial predicted reduction in Ending Rate is off-set by long-term increases in the Recommend Step Down Rate, thus not permanently impacting the new patient start rate. Both new patient starts and wait times in our clinic increase in the short-term, but fall below our historical average by 3 months, and continue to fall for the next year. However, because there have been no changes in Primary Care, the number of patients waiting to step down to PC hs increased substantially – from about 110 to 170, who are all undoubtedly waiting significantly longer than before.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>CC</strong> - Next time we will experiment with adjusting our Return Visit Interval.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MM</strong> - Although we were glad to see that we could care for more OUD patients with our available staffing, we are concerned that if all we do is shift several of our Other appointments to OUD, we won’t be able to help as many Other patients. We decided to experiment with Return to Clinic Visit Intervals as a possible alternate solution.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>PSY</strong> - For our next experiment, since we have now affirmed that we have additional appt capacity for new (and existing patients), we would like to explore how changing Initiators who Complete from the base case rate of 37% to 75% might impact the number of patients who complete and graduate. This will be the only change we make, so that we can see the effect clearly.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>AGG</strong> - Now that we have reduced the RVI for PSY and EB PSY, we can look to see what gains in managing our patients may be achieved by rebalancing our service mix. We’ll see what happens if we invest in doing more EB PSY and less PSY, but keeping the proportion of other services more or less as before.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>SP</strong> - In this experiment, we see a strong connection between changes made in our team and demand and wait times for downstream teams. We should run an experiment that explores these connections, specifically to gauge the impacts of implementing stepped care between GMH and PC/PCMHI.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In an interconnected system, with causal interdependencies over time, simulation can help us find out when our short-term decisions are going to make things worse in the longer term. In the real world, it would be very hard to perceive these longer term system effects, but we can see them using <em>Modeling to Learn</em> and we can evaluate the results against other available decisions to compare their effects and better coordinate Veterans’ care across the team to increase care quality [expand access, or reduce symptoms and risk].</p>

<p><strong>We’ll work to apply these skills as we review our combined experiment 3 today.</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Log in to mtl.how/sim and join the current session.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. From the experiment section, pull up the prior experiment and click the red “Go” button.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Check the box to include the text from that experiment and click “Go” again.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Note that the sliders have moved to the settings for that experiment.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The experiment sliders automatically adjust to the prior experiment we just selected.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Open the Outputs and Text section and select another earlier experiment to compare to the one you have just pulled up.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Select the two previous experiments, base case from Session 7 and experiment 1 from Session 8, to compare.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Note the variables that were manipulated in the two experiments.</strong></p>
<p><strong>7. Review the findings from the two experiments in the results dashboard and the text entered for Hypothesis, Findings and Decisions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>8. Collapse the Outputs and Text section and move it to the side to reveal the causal system model diagram.</strong></p>
<p><strong>9. Use the diagram to tell a causal systems story about the differences in the two experiments.</strong></p>
<p><a href="#."><img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_question.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/></a> <strong>Our Question.</strong> <em>Briefly describe what your team wants to learn from this experiment.</em></p>
<p><strong>10. Consider running a combination experiment that incorporates the sliders manipulated in both experiments.</strong></p>

<p><strong>11. Replace text in the Q/H/F/D boxes to reflect the team’s hypotheses and expectations for the combined experiment.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use the model diagram to develop a <strong>Dynamic Hypothesis</strong> about the expected system behaviors that the combined decisions in Experiment 3 will produce. Enter your Hypothesis and delete prior Findings and Decisions.</li>
<li>Ask, “What do you think the effects will be of these changes? How much better will things get?” Push the team to be as specific as possible, both with their change and the result.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>12. Save, name, and run the combined experiment.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Move the text to the left to adjust the experiment sliders to reflect the desired Experiment 3, then save, name, and run the experiment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>13. Discuss and record results and decisions, including your thinking about long-term trends in your clinic’s EBP reach under various decision scenarios.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In the Results Dashboard, review how causal feedback explains why the decisions in experiment 3 combine to produce the relative differences in specific variables and values over time. Enter your Findings about causal relationships that explain the differences in short- and long-term trends between the base case, experiment 1, experiment 2, and experiment 3. Document decisions the team will consider implementing in the clinic.</li>
<li><em>Model systems thinking for the team by highlighting the C.F.B.T. systems thinking concepts that are included in the q/h/f/d text boxes.</em></li>
<li><em>Note the <strong>dominant causal feedback that produces the system behaviors,</strong> and note the <strong>highest leverage (high yield) decisions</strong> that are most <strong>clinically feasible</strong> for the team to implement in their care.</em></li>

<p><strong>Learning Objectives</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Describe what your team has prioritized as decisions to implement in your clinic.</li>
<li>Test your team’s plan against your individual and shared team vision.</li>
<li>Apply your team’s plan in clinical decisions using C.F.B.T. systems thinking.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Let’s get started</strong></p>
<p><strong>In-session Exercise (30 minutes): Pulling together team learnings, decisions, and vision</strong></p>
<p><strong>Connect learning and decisions from experiments to original team vision, question, and need</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. What shared vision did the team decide on in session 1?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Throughout <em>Modeling to Learn</em>, we’ve made lots of team decisions. Let’s review them and see what they mean for future decisions. What shared vision for <em>Modeling to Learn</em> did the team decide on in Session 1? We’ve tied our experiments and decisions throughout <em>MTL</em> to that vision.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. What team need and questions did we identify?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In sessions 2 and 3 we explored team data and trends using the <em>MTL</em> data UI. We learned how to find an individual patient, how to visualize trends over time for our own care or the teams’ as a whole. And we built our team data file for use in the sim. In session 4 we completed the <em>MTL</em> Menu to prioritize our team’s need. What questions did we identify and study over the next 5 sessions, using the sim UI to better understand the <strong>causal systems story</strong> of our team’s need over time?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. What hypotheses did we test?</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. What insights will we keep in mind as we make clinic decisions?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Let’s discuss what our Findings and Decisions mean for the team going forward. <em>As we discuss new individual and team practice decisions keep in mind the systems thinking rationale for <strong>why</strong> a practice decision would lead to desired outcomes over time.</em> As we discuss these questions consider <strong>Complexity,</strong> <strong>Feedback,</strong> and <strong>System Behavior</strong> over <strong>Time.</strong> What insights will we keep in mind as we make future clinic decisions?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. What new approaches or targets do we want to focus on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Let’s think about the key insights we’ve gotten about decisions that are within our control.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. What concrete actions will the team take in the real world?</strong></p>
<p><strong>7. How do these decisions align with the team’s shared vision, question and needs?</strong></p>
<p><strong>8. What data will we watch to see how we’re doing?</strong></p>
<p><strong>That’s it for <em>Modeling to Learn</em> how to make <em>future team decisions</em>. Next is our Done/Do review.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Done and Do (15 minutes)</strong></p>

<p><strong>MTL RESOURCES</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://mtl.how/sim"><img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/logos/mtl_how_sim.png" height = "75" width = "110"></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>You will continue to have access to the sim UI at mtl.how/sim. Remember that you can use the sim UI in two ways. You can log in to your individual world and play on your own, or the team can explore together in the team world. Let’s review the special features of each of the 5 modules and what kinds of needs they can help you think through.</p></li>
<li><p>In Care Coordination (CC), you can compare multiple experiments and look at things like how Overwork Affects No-Shows and how you Balance New and Existing Patients.</p></li>
<li><p>In Medication Management (MM) you can experiment with team decisions across different diagnostic cohorts and how best to allocate appointments for your providers with and without x-waivers.</p></li>
<li><p>In Psychotherapy (PSY), you can look at different patterns of engagement that patients may follow. In the team data table for PSY, you can pull up charts to see a profile of the team’s historical patient engagement pattern; and in the Outputs section you can look at the Sankey diagram to compare patient engagement patterns and the associated appointment usage for different experiments.</p></li>
<li><p>In the Aggregate (AGG) module, you can test hypotheses about your overall mix of services. The unique feature here is that in Outputs, you can choose to compare either different experiments (as you can in all the modules), or you can compare the effects of a given experiment across the different services.</p></li>
<li><p>The Measurement Based Stepped Care and Suicide Prevention(SP) module allows you to run experiments involving multiple mental health care settings, to see how decisions made in one setting impact patient care and wait times across the continuum of care.</p></li>
<li><p>Another resource is the library of <em>MTL</em> videos, available at mtl.how/video. For sessions 5 through 10 which involve simulation, there are recordings not just for the module your team decided to use, but for all 5. Like <em>Modeling to Learn</em> Live, MTL Videos are accredited through TMS for continuing education credits.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, you can join the <em>Modeling to Learn</em> Listserv at <a href="mailto:mtl.how@va.gov" class="email">mtl.how@va.gov</a>; and you can always email questions for <em>MTL</em> staff to <a href="mailto:mtl.help@va.gov" class="email">mtl.help@va.gov</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Now let’s make a plan for how the team will keep modeling to learn going forward.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How could you, as a clinician, or the team as a whole, see using these resources to continue quality improvement through team decision-making?</li>
<li>Is there another big question you’d like to explore through simulated experiments - either in the same module or a different one?</li>
<li>Could it be helpful to refer back the model diagram as a reminder of the systems stories it tells about decisions you make as a team?</li>
<li>Do you want to set aside some specific times - a portion of a meeting every week, or month, or quarter, say, to further explore your data and test your hypotheses?</li>
<li>How might you share these resources with new team members, and give them a dose of systems thinking?</li>
<li>Is there anyone who’d like to keep up their <em>MTL</em> skills and be a local <em>MTL</em> champion or coach, to remind the team of MTL when a new challenge appears on the horizon?</li>
<li>Some teams ask for a “booster” session after a few months. We’re happy to facilitate that as well.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>It’s great if you make a concrete action plan, identify a point person, and call on us as needed.</strong></p>
