### [Session 03 Say Checklist](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/mtl_facilitate_workgroup/mtl_live_guide/mtl_live_session03_see.Rmd)

**Today we're modeling to learn how to produce team data for simulation.**
  
- [ ] Hello! I'm __________ and I'm __________ [Co-facilitators introduce themselves]. Today we're modeling to learn how to produce team data for simulation.

**Navigate to the SEE guide to show Done/Do table**

- [ ] [<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/done.png" height = "40" width = "40">](#DontClick) Done: We reviewed the HF, Diag, Enc and SP tabs in your team data to find a patient and a team trend. We opened mtl.how/data in a browser and looked at the two team folders: data UI and team data table.  
- [ ] [<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/do.png" height = "40" width = "40">](#DontClick) 
Do: We will produce a team data table for the _MTL_ simulation user-interface (sim UI).

**Learning Objectives for Session 3**

1. Describe your team trends over the last two years based on the estimates in the team data table.
2. Test out your understanding of how the team data is estimated through review of the descriptions and definitions. 
3. Apply your clinical expertise to consider the team trends in the data UI and team data table to identify team priorities for learning.

**Start In-session Exercise**
[<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style = “display:inline-block”/>](#DontClick) ____________ **Time 00:10-00:15 – Review Graphic & Navigate to mtl.how/data**
- [ ] We will use the data UI to look back at team trends over the past two years - *what is*;  
- [ ] We will use the sim UI to look at team trends 2 years into the future to answer *what if* questions about different decisions the team could make.

**1. Navigate to the data UI at mtl.how/data. **

- [ ] Data UI on VA's secure SharePoint site; works on any browser.
- [ ] You must have your PIV card engaged and you should have all the same permissions to access the site. 
- [ ] Scroll down to see your team folders: data_ui and team_data_table. Click on the "data_ui" folder and open the Excel file.  

[<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style = “display:inline-block”/>](#DontClick) ____________ **Time 00:15-00:25 – Review how to “Get Team Data Table"**

**2. Clicking the "Get Team Data Table for Sim UI" button produces a table of descriptive team data.**
**IMPORTANT: You already have a fresh Team Data Table for Sim UI file to work with in your team_data_table folder. **

- [ ] Takes time to generate a team data table for all modules using your team's data; depending team size
- [ ] Data in this file are means, medians and percentages of key variables likely to influence the team's priorities for learning from *Modeling to Learn*. 
- [ ] There are team data produced for each module of *Modeling to Learn*, each stored in its own tab:
   + Care Coordination (CC) - tab title *CCParams*
   + Medication Management (MM) - tab title *MMParams*
   + Psychotherapy (PSY) - tab title *PSYParams*
   + Aggregate team services (AGG) - tab title *AggParams*
   + Measurement-based stepped care and suicide prevention (SP) - tab title *SPParams*

*- [ ] Team data table is already generated for you, but to do it for yourself:*  
    -- [ ] Select a set of clinics in **ClinicSelection tab**.  
    -- [ ] Click on "create Team Data Table"  

**See SAY guide for narration details on generating file for SP module  **

- The file you generate will have all five module tabs and labels, but will produce "zeroes/0" as values for parameters of the modules that **were not** selected.  
 - Navigate back to your team folder at mtl.how/data. Click on the "team_data_table" folder and open the Excel file to find the team data table already produced for you.  
 
 [<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style = “display:inline-block”/>](#DontClick) ____________ **Time 00:25-00:35 – Select and review a *MTL* Module**

**3. Let's select a module for review - to show what data are used to tailor each *MTL* module to your team. ** 

**[Choose a module] – *See SAY guide for descriptions of each module*  **

- [ ] Check out the different modules that are highlighted in the team data on the screen. As we review, we will use the mouse to highlight key team data variables.  
- [ ] Find a variable important to your team. Look at how it is estimated in the table and notice the units.  
- [ ] Params tabs have more detailed information about team data.  
- [ ] Review the two columns to the right of the numerical data [show with mouse]:  
	-- This column [highlight column] gives the description or definition of the variable.  
	-- This column [highlight column] contains additional details about how individual patient data are extracted and used to calculate your team’s historical trends.  

[<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style = “display:inline-block”/>](#DontClick) ____________ **Time 00:35-00:45 – Select and review a second *MTL* Module**  

**4. Let’s select a second module for review.  **

- [ ] Again, check out the last 2 columns, to the right of the numerical data.  
- [ ] Find a variable important to the team. How is it estimated in this table? What are its units?   
- [ ] Where can you find even more detailed information about your team data? Click on the “DataNotes” tab for a breakdown of how the patient cohort is defined, CPT codes used, and patient engagement patterns (PSY module).  

[<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style = “display:inline-block”/>](#DontClick) ____________ **Time 00:45-00:50 – Explore team data table values of interest to the team**  

**5. Are there any team data table values you would like to explore in the team data UI?**
**6. Do you see any team data values that differ a lot from what you would expect?** 
**7. Do you see any team data values that confirm your thoughts about high priority team needs?**

- [ ] What are you noticing? What is surprising?
- [ ] In what ways does the team data fit with your day-to-day experience?  

**That's it for _Modeling to learn_ how to produce team data for simulation. Next is our Done/Do review.**

**Navigate to the SEE guide to show Done/Do table  **
[<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style = “display:inline-block”/>](#DontClick) ____________ **Time 00:50-01:00 – Done / Do Review**  

 
- [ ] [<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/done.png" height = "40" width = "40">](#DontClick) Done: We produced team data for the _MTL_ simulation user-interface (sim UI).  
- [ ] [<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/do.png" height = "40" width = "40">](#DontClick) Do: Find something in the team data table. Complete the mtl.how/menu to prioritize your needs. Responses are confidential.  

**DO demo**

- Encourage team members to look around in the team data table before next time. 
- Ask team members to fill out form at mtl.how/menu (open on Chrome or Edge for the best experience).
- The username is yout VA email. It will take about 5 minutes. 
- Responses will be aggregated and discussed in Session 4 to help choose which *MTL* module we'll use for the next several sessions of *Modeling to Learn*.

**Until next time, thank you for *Modeling to Learn*!**
