# Admin Technical Manual

As a _MTL_ Admin, the following chapters will help answer any technical questions you may have when support Facilitators and Learners during prep and live team meetings.

## Modeling To Learn Administrative Dashboard

The _MTL_ Administrative Dashboard provides customizable information and messaging capabilities for webpages in the Sim UI.

### Login to Administrative Dashboards

3. Review information in the pop up.

<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/gh-pages/images/review_issue.png?raw=true">

### Manage Outgoing Messages

The Sim UI sends out email and other messages to mass-communicate important information.  There are 5 types of messages.

1. **I have an idea:**  This is an outgoing email that informs the user that we have received their idea.
2. **I like something:** This is an outgoing email that informs the user that we have received and appreciate their message.
3. **Report Bug:** This is an outgoing email that informs the user that we have received their bug report and will act on it. It also returns an issue number for their reference.
4. **News:** Every user has a News button on their Home webpage. When clicked, it will display news items on their webpage that were set up with this function.
5. **Alert:** Also known as an ANDON alert, this is an outgoing message that displays on the Home webpage when the user logs in.  It can target facilitators only, users only or both.  ANDONS are normally reserved for problems where the user should stop using the Sim UI until the issue is resolved.

<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/gh-pages/images/manage_out_msg.png?raw=true">

#### Target ANDON Alert Users

As explained in 5. above, you can target specific users with an ANDON Alert.  When "Alert" is selected from the Message dropdown, an additional "Show Message to Whom" will appear.  Select the target audience and click "Add Message."

<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/gh-pages/images/andon_alert.png?raw=true">

## Manage _MTL_ Demo Website

The _MTL_ Demo website provides interested users access to a demonstration simulation.  The webpage also offers information about the research project, associated training and video materials and highlights partners that had a hand in its development. The admin website enables the admin to adjust webpage content and demo users.

### _MTL_ Demo Website

Navigate to [_MTL_ Demo](https://forio.com/app/va/va-psd-demo/mtl_demo.html) to view example below. To modify this webpage, click on the _MTL_ Demo icon in your Facilitator Dashboard.

<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/gh-pages/images/mtl_demo_website.png?raw=true">

### Orient to the _MTL_ Demo Admin Webpage

1. Export User Data section lists users that have registered for access to the _MTL_ Demo simulation. It lists their names and contact information.  The typical registration is for 14 days. However, with a Course Code, the length of the registration can be longer. A user's access time can be improved, but **it must be done before the original date expires.**
2. Resource Management section manages the information contained on the _MTL_ website. The sections supported are Run, Videos, Slides, Papers and Funding.
3. MTL Demo - Slider section is where the GIF slider files are uploaded.

 <img src = "https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/gh-pages/images/mtl_demo_orient.png?raw=true">

### Update Course Code

Sometimes we present _Modeling to Learn_ in seminars and other academic gatherings. To enable participants to experience _MTL_, we provide a course code that enables users to access the platform longer than the standard 14 days.

 <img src = "https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/gh-pages/images/mtl_demo_course_code1.png?raw=true">
 
 <img src = "https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/gh-pages/images/mtl_demo_course_code2.png?raw=true">

## Quick Tips

When a screen loads in the Sim UI, a blank gray screen in presented.  We use this opportunity to offer suggestions or "Tips" to explain functions in the Sim UI.  We have an admin webpage to create new Tips.  Tips usually have graphics, which are white line drawings on transparent background saved in the .svg format. When paired with text, these present on the loading screen (see example below). A repository of quick tips icons are available in [lzim/mtl/images/quick_tips_files](https://github.com/lzim/mtl/gh-pages/images/quick_tips_files).

**Please note that _MTL_ Demo has its own tips management admin page.**
**To access, you must first navigate to the _MTL_ Demo admin page, THEN click the "Tips" icon. You can verify you are on the right page, because the URL will say "va-psd-sim/qtipadmin.html" if you are in PROD Tips and "va-psd-demo/qtipadmin.html" if you are in the DEMO Tips.**

 <img src = "https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/gh-pages/images/mtl_tips_quick_tip_screen.png?raw=true">

### Update a Quick Tip

1. From the Administrator Dashboard, click on the "Tips" icon. The _MTL_ Quick Tip Loading Screen Administration page will open.
2. Click the "Add Tip" button. The page will scroll to the bottom of the list and present a new row to input information.

## Tutor Function

The Tutor is a function in the Sim UI that explains functions on the webpage to the user. Each section on the Home, CC, MM, PSY, AGG, and SP pages have a Tutor icon.

 <img src = "https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/gh-pages/images/mtl_tutor_desc.png?raw=true">

### Tutor Administrative Dashboard

The Admin Dashboard enables you to adjust descriptive text and links associated with each Tutor call out box.  **However, the user cannot add or remove Tutor call outs.** These have to be put in using computer code. See below for a description of these features.

1. Each page in the Sim UI has Tutor call outs.  This points to the call outs on the Home Page.  Below are Tutor call out listings for CC, MM, PSY, AGG and SP modules.

## Forio Epicenter

Forio Epicenter is an enterprise platform that hosts our Sim UI and runs the simulations for end-users. While the Sim UI can manage most administrator-user needs within the web interface, sometimes it is necessary to go directly into Epicenter to, for example, set up a new end-user in Epicenter. Click [Epicenter](https://forio.com/epicenter/sign-in) to go to the login.

### Send Password Reset to End User

<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/gh-pages/images/navigate_to_vet_affairs_project.png?raw=true">
  
#### Select End User from Menu
  
You can search for the user by using the search bar.

<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/gh-pages/images/select_end_user.png?raw=true">
  
#### Click on the Password Reset
  
You can also change the password directly for the user by selecting the "Change Password" from the dropdown.

<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/gh-pages/images/click_password_link.png?raw=true">

### Set up A New Epicenter End User

#### Navigate to A Project

Note that you would navigate to various projects to set up end users in different instances of the Sim UI.  For example, you would navigate to VA Sim UI-TEST-Slow to set an end-user up in the TEST environment.

<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/gh-pages/images/select_prod_project.png?raw=true">

#### Navigate to Group Page

In the Epicenter hierarchy, "groups" are the highest entity.  Underneath groups are worlds.  In TeamPSD, we refer to groups as "teams."  Typically, we auto-setup a \_team group and a \_ind group to manage team assignments and individual worlds.

<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/gh-pages/images/click_groups.png?raw=true">

#### Select Desired Group
  
<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/gh-pages/images/select_desired_group.png?raw=true">

#### Click Add End User Button

<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/gh-pages/images/add_end_users.png?raw=true">

#### Add User Email to Field and Click "Add/invite User" Button

We usually put the user's VA email address in this field.  However, it does not have to be an email unless you are sending a notice via email to the user. Sometimes users just need an alias besides their email address.

<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/gh-pages/images/add_invite_user.png?raw=true">

### Set up a team

**We don't set up teams directly in Epicenter anymore,** because there are multiple dependencies in the Sim UI that would be bypassed. See chapter 7.3 for more information about setting up a team on the Facilitator Dashboard. 

### Set up an Admin

To set up an Admin, the end-user id must be assigned to the administrator_login group on the groups page.
