## MTL Facilitate Pre-Session Checklist

**Decide who will be the pre/post prep co-facilitator, who will be the live lead facilitator.**

### The week before of the meeting 

**Pre/Post Emails to be sent by Jenn**
1. Send the pre-session team email.

### Day of session Prep Checklist (30 minutes)  

**Pre/Post Co-facilitator**
Check the session_resources card at the top of each session column at [mtl.how/team_tracker](mtl.how/team_tracker) for a list of relevant 1) platforms and 2) guides/checklists to prep for each session.

**Live Lead Facilitator (should be done during the post-session debrief and reviewed during the prep meeting)**

1. Open the [SEE file](https://mtl.how) at mtl.how for learners.

2. Open the [team_tracker checklist](https://mtl.how/team_tracker) at mtl.how/team_tracker for team details prepped during intersession prep.

3. Divvy up in-session tasks (who will do what e.g., cover the do/done, review the hypothesis from last meeting) with specific time stamps between the two co-facilitators and note these decisions on the [team_tracker checklist](https://mtl.how/team_tracker) for that team.
