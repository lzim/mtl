**Learning Objectives for Session 5 - After this session you will be able to:**  

1. Describe the team data in the Experiments section.  
2. Test out the simulation user interface for more information about team data.  
3. Apply clinical expertise to consider the decisions the team makes that affect these data variables.  

**Start Participatory Learning from Simulation (30 minutes)**

[<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/illustrations/data_ui_sim_ui.png">](#DontClick)  

- [ ] In sessions 2 and 3, we reviewed use of data UI to examine team trends over the past two years *WHAT IS*  
  - Cite example of what team noted in team data: *For example, we saw that...*  
- [ ] Focus of today is use of simulation user interface or SIM UI is to explore *WHAT IF*
  - We will ask *WHAT IF* questions about different decisions the team could make, hypothesize about the results, and examine findings to inform future decisions.  
 
**Start In-session Exercise (30 minutes)**  
[<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style = “display:inline-block”/>](#DontClick) ____________ **Time 00:15-00:25 – Confirm team lead for the day and upload data file to SIM UI**  

**1. In session 3, we used our team data UI and clicked "Create Team Data Table" to produce our team data for simulation.**  

- [ ] Identify team lead  

**2. Let's now go back to mtl.how/data in your browser window to check the name of our team_data_table file**  

- [ ] Guide team lead to mtl.how/data and then to the team_data_table file  

**3. The team data file for simulation is in our team folder, in the team_data_table folder.**  

- [ ] Navigate to the team_data_table folder and click the "dot-dot-dot" so you can copy the filename of your team_data_table  

**4. Guide team lead to log in to the sim UI.** 

- [ ] Open a new browser window in Chrome or Edge and go to mtl.how/sim  
- [ ] Enter log in credentials: user name is VA email and password was provided to the team in the email sent last week.
- [ ] Click the down-arrow in the *Please select a World* pop-up. Two options:"team" and "ind" for "individual". Since we're working together now as a team, choose the team world. If you are exploring the sim UI on your own, it's best to select your individual world.   
- [ ] Note the SIM UI application has a responsive web design, so it adjusts the page layout to optimize to your screen's dimensions  
- [ ] If there is a critical issue that everyone needs to be alerted to, there will be a red "Alert" pop-up upon login.  

**5. Orient yourself to the home page (Team name, navigation icons, player name, welcome text, sections with blue headers).**  

- [ ] From top left *MTL* logo - acts as a Home button - to right, six navigation icons: Home, Play, Team, More Info, News, Report Bug, Tutor and Logoff. Click on each to help the team understand purpose for each.  
  - [ ] Highlight importance of logging off
- [ ] Click on the "Community" button on the bottom right if you have an idea, like something, or have a question.  
  - [ ] Community of Practice (CoP) contains FAQs and if you set up a GitHub account, you can ask your questions directly in the CoP or email *MTL* at mtl.help@va.gov  
 
  - [ ] **Never include any PII/PHI in descriptions and screenshots unless you are emailing mtl.help@va.gov. The Community of Practice is a public platform.**
   
- [ ] Review *MTL* welcome text below the top navigation bar. Review the 3 section headings in blue bars: Session, Experiment Maintenance, and Team Data Dropdown Maintenance.  
  - [ ] Whenever you see blue bars like these with a white triangle on the right, that means those sections can be expanded and collapsed by clicking on the bar.  
  - [ ] If you're not designated as a Team Lead, you won't see all of these features. But everyone is the “Team Lead” for their individual world, so will see all of these sections when you're logged in there.  
  - [ ] Review Experiment Maintenance section - delete, rename, or export experiments.  

**6. Start a New Session** [ [<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "15" width = "15">](#DontClick)__ ]  

- [ ] Start a New Session and review the sim UI Main Page.   
- [ ] Select the module your team decided to use.  
- [ ] Select the team data you just uploaded.  

- [ ] Click Play. (For the Care Coordination and Medication Management (CC & MM) modules, after you click Play, you need to select your Learning Mode.)
Refer to the Care Coordination (CCParams) or Medication Management (MMParams) tab of the Team Data Table at mtl.how/data, for data regarding the team's New Patient Start Rates and Return-to-Clinic Intervals.
- [ ] Note: Once you pick a Learning Mode to prioritize the New Patient Start Rate or the Existing Patients Return-to-Clinic Visit Interval, this will be the setting your team will experiment with through Session 12 for the rest of the Modeling to Learn program.

- [ ] Existing Patient Return-to-Clinic Visit Interval: Choose this learning mode to prioritize the Existing Patients Return-to-Clinic Visit Interval (RVI) estimated from team data, and only start new patients in remaining open slots after the existing patient RVI, appointment supply, and missed appointments are all taken into account.
- [ ] New Patient Start Rate: Choose this learning mode to prioritize the New Patient Start Rate estimated from team data, and only see existing patients in remaining open slots after the new patient start rate, appointment supply, and missed appointments are all taken into account.
Upon clicking icons like "Play," "Run," or "Reset,' a quick tip will appear on the loading screen on different functions in the sim UI.

**7. Orient yourself to the Main Page of the Sim UI (Notice the same information and buttons at top; 4 sections with blue header - one showing the module and team data selected in its header; the others headed Outputs and Text, Experiments, and Text).**

- [ ] You see the same information and buttons across the top as the Home page.
- [ ] There's a new set of sections with blue headers below that. Let's click inside the large blue header on the left to minimize that section, because we aren't going to need it today. But notice inside that bar it tells you which module and team data file we selected.
- [ ] To the right of the main section are 3 blue bars labeled Outputs and Text, Experiments, and Text. 
    - You can drag the Text section around by the blue bar. You can also expand, minimize, or close it with the icons on the top right side of the blue bar. 
    - Expand it to open up the Outputs section, including the Text boxes. Reduce it back to Text-only the same way you expanded it. 
    - If you close it with the X, you can get it back by going to the Outputs and Text section and selecting Expand.
- [ ] You can use the app's responsive design feature to enlarge the view. Use the magnifier (+/-) or the shortcut Control/Shift/+ (or minus) to make things bigger or smaller. At some point, the design layout changes to stacked sections instead of having them side by side. This is the way it will look on a smartphone screen, or sometimes with other types of monitors.
- [ ] Record the team's high-level learning Question.
- [ ] Open and expand the Outputs and Text section if you need to.
- [ ] Type your question about _________________________________ into the Question box.
- [ ] Click Save. We will discuss naming more next time. For now, just click the down arrow at the first prompt and choose "bc" (stands for base case), and Add, then click the Save button at the top. (We do not want to "save and reset".) Click Yes at the prompt.
- [ ] Check out the Team Data Table.

**8. Expand the Experiments section and read the "i" information for the Team Data Table.**

- [ ] Open the section by clicking on the white down arrow in the right corner of the blue bar.
- [ ] The data in this table come straight from the file we just uploaded. In fact, throughout the sim UI, we've used the convention that red font means "read in from team data".
- [ ] Click on the "i" in the red circle next to Team Data and read the "i" information. Throughout the Sim UI, we use "i" symbols for information pop-ups. Here, the "i" information is telling you how the data that you record, that you reviewed and chose in the data UI, are used to calculate or estimate the values in this Team Data Table.
- [ ] What types of decisions does the team make that affect these variables?
- [ ] Close the "i" information and look over the values - how do they strike you? Do they line up with how you think things are in your team? In particular, notice 

**9. Find the Team Data Table variables in the system diagram at the left.**

- [ ] True Missed Appointments %
- [ ] Appointment Supply
- [ ] Return Visit Interval
- [ ] Engagement Duration
- [ ] New Patient Start Rate (AGG)

**10. Log out of the Sim UI.**

- [ ] That's it for Modeling to Learn how to log in to our team world!

**Have Team Lead pull up the session 05 SEE guide Done/Do review.**

- [ ] We logged in and uploaded our team data table to the sim UI, and reviewed our team data in the Experiments section.	 
- [ ] Check the "i" information available in the sim UI Model Diagram and Experiments section.

**DO demo**

- [ ] For next time, if you can, log in to to the sim UI at mtl.how/sim.
- [ ] Remember that when you first enter your log-in credentials, you'll be able to choose between your Team world and your Individual world. If you choose your Team world, it will already have a "session" started - because we did that today when we chose the module and selected the team data file that we had added. So you will choose Join Current Session and click Play.
- [ ] If you're ambitious to dig in and "play" in the sim, you can choose your Individual world and add the team data to the team data menu the same way we did just now. Then you can choose the module, select the data, and click Play. You can explore to your heart's content in your Individual world without worrying that you'll "break" anything or change anything for the rest of your team.
- [ ] Whichever way you get to hitting Play from the Sim UI landing page, it will take you to the main page for the module. We encourage you to explore the interface more.
- [ ] In particular, check out the “i” information available throughout the sim UI - in the Experiments section and in the model diagram - to prepare for our next session.
