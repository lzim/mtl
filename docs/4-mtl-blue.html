<p><strong>Learning Objectives</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Describe your own vision for what you would like your team to get from <em>Modeling to Learn</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Test out your thinking with your team about what your shared vision is for becoming a “dream team.”</p></li>
<li><p>Identify a shared team vision for learning from <em>Modeling to Learn</em>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>In-session Exercise (30 minutes)</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Prior Team Learning Prompt (5 minutes)</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Think of a good learning experience in your team. It can be in a meeting or an informal exchange with a colleague. It can be when you learned a clinic procedure, an idea for treatment with a difficult patient, or when a team member unlocked a mystery of CPRS for you. Try to think of a time when you had an ‘aha!’ or something finally made sense, or you could finally do something you couldn’t before.</p></li>
<li><p>Jot down on scratch paper what it was that made it a good learning experience. What were the characteristics of the experience? Compile a team list:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Most likely the following are true:*
<ul>
<li>The learning was hands-on and experiential.</li>
<li>The learning connected to the real world.</li>
<li>The learning experience was personally relevant, interesting, useful, or meaningful to the learner.</li>
<li>The learner had choices, shared authority, control, and responsibility.</li>
<li>The learner learned from and taught others.</li>
<li>The learner had the support he or she needed.</li>
<li>The learning was individualized. If there were standards for the work, the learner could meet them in his or her own way.</li>
<li>It was fun or left the learner feeling good.</li>
<li>The experience helped the learner understand him- or herself.</li>
<li>The learner experienced success and accomplishment with challenging work.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Best Case Scenario (5 minutes)</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Create team language for learning, aligning team decisions when there are roadblocks to consensus. Start by picturing Veteran mental health care in this team as you experience it now – the interactions/communications within the team in and out of team meetings; the key people you rely on outside the team; the information and data you use to coordinate care plans, and the feelings you associate with it.</p></li>
<li><p>Now picture the team learning over the next 6 months in a ‘best-case’ scenario, where things are happening in the team the way that you would ideally like them to. This is your “dream team” situation.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>3. Personal Vision (5 minutes)</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>What is team communication like?</p></li>
<li><p>How do team members relate to one another?</p></li>
<li><p>How is VA data used?</p></li>
<li><p>How are decisions, plans and changes made?</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>4. Review in Team (5 minutes)</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>What stands out to you?</p></li>
<li><p>Why did we choose these?</p></li>
<li><p>What makes them so relevant or important to us?</p></li>
<li><p>Can we address them all (bearing in mind our resources and time)?</p></li>
<li><p>If not, which would we most like to address (align around), and why?</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>5. Putting it Together (10 minutes)</strong></p>
<p>Overall “Modeling to Learn” objectives include activities and competencies that:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Are meaningful for you and align your learning goals with your team’s.</p></li>
<li><p>Develop systems thinking skills - help you see how several things fit together and understand causes that are hard to see without data and modeling resources.</p></li>
<li><p>Make VA data, initiatives and standards transparent to you.</p></li>
<li><p>Empower you to realize ongoing improvements in team quality of care and team quality of work life.</p></li>

<p><strong>By the end of this session you will be able to:</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Describe your own vision for what you would like your team to get from <em>Modeling to Learn</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Test out your thinking with your team about what your shared vision is for becoming a “dream team.”</p></li>
<li><p>Identify a shared team vision for learning from <em>Modeling to Learn</em>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Let’s get started!</strong></p>
<p><strong>In-session Exercise (30 minutes): Team vision</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We learn best when we seek to accomplish things that matter to us. Today we will clarify what we are trying to accomplish together with <em>Modeling to Learn</em>. This learning process will be something you commit to because it reflects a key part your own vision for care in this team.</li>
<li>Identifying a shared purpose can be deeply motivating. We want to identify a shared purpose about what we are trying to achieve as a team participating in <em>Modeling to Learn</em>. The team learning goal provides the focus and energy for committing to learning together over the coming weeks. We have limited time, so we want to identify what is most central to team learning goals and connect this to daily team care delivery.</li>
<li>Team learning is all about ‘alignment’ and getting people working in sync with one another to meet the needs of our Veteran patients. We will explore “what is” (retrospective data) and vision forward to “what we would like it to be” (future-oriented).</li>
<li>The goal is to move from “my vision” to “our vision” and to shift the paradigm towards how things could be done with shared decision-making. Together, the clinic team lead and facilitation team will explore “What can be done better?” in a way that reflects common team aspirations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1. Prior Team Learning Prompt (5 minutes)</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>First, we want to set ground rules for our learning sessions. Think of a good learning experience in your team. It can be in a meeting or an informal exchange with a colleague. It can be when you learned a clinic procedure, an idea for treatment with a difficult patient, or when a team member unlocked a mystery of CPRS for you. Try to think of a time when you had an “aha!” Something finally made sense, or you could finally do something you couldn’t before.</p></li>
<li><p>Jot down on scratch paper what it was that made it a good learning experience. What were the characteristics of the experience? Compile a team list.</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><em>Most likely the following are true:</em>
<ul>
<li>The learning was hands-on and experiential.</li>
<li>The learning is connected to the real world.</li>
<li>The learning experience was personally relevant, interesting, useful, or meaningful to the learner.</li>
<li>The learner had choices, shared authority, control, and responsibility.</li>
<li>The learner learned from and taught others.</li>
<li>The learner had the support he or she needed.</li>
<li>The learning was individualized. If there were standards for the work, the learner could meet them in his or her own way.</li>
<li>It was fun or left the learner feeling good.</li>
<li>The experience helped the learner understand him- or herself.</li>
<li>The learner experienced success and accomplishment with challenging work.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Best Case Scenario (5 minutes)</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Now let’s envision our <em>Best Case Scenario</em>. It is important to create a team language for learning; for aligning team decisions when there are roadblocks to consensus. Start by picturing Veteran mental health care in this team as you experience it now. The interactions and communications within the team, in and out of team meetings. The key people you rely on outside the team. The information and data you use to coordinate care plans, and the feelings you associate with it.</p></li>
<li><p>Now picture the team learning over the next 6 months in a <em>best case</em> scenario, where things are happening in the team the way that you would ideally like them to. This is your <em>dream team</em> situation.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>3. Personal Vision (5 minutes)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Think about your Personal Vision for your team:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>What is team communication like?</p></li>
<li><p>How do team members relate to one another?</p></li>
<li><p>How is VA data used?</p></li>
<li><p>How are decisions, plans and changes made?</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Review in Team (5 minutes)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Reflecting as a team on those individual visions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>What stands out to you?</p></li>
<li><p>Why did we choose these?</p></li>
<li><p>What makes them so relevant or important to us?</p></li>
<li><p>Can we address them all (bearing in mind our resources and time)?</p></li>
<li><p>If not, which would we most like to address (align around), and why?</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Putting it Together (10 minutes)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Putting it all together, overall <em>Modeling to Learn</em> objectives include activities and competencies that:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Are meaningful for you and align your learning goals with your team.</p></li>
<li><p>Develop systems thinking skills that help you to see how several things fit together and understand causes that are hard to see without data and modeling resources.</p></li>
<li><p>Make VA data, initiatives and standards transparent to you.</p></li>
<li><p>Empower you to realize ongoing improvements in team quality of care and team quality of work life.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>6. Select the Team Vision</strong></p>

<p><strong>Participatory Learning from Simulation</strong></p>
<p>This graphic illustrates how <strong><em>Modeling to Learn</em></strong> can help us to get more of our Veterans to the right care in the right time to meet their needs using participatory learning from simulation.</p>
<ul>
<li>We use the data user interface (UI) to look back at team trends over the past two years.</li>
<li>We review the last two years of data to see <em>what is</em> in our team now.</li>
<li>Backward looking data review is limited for guiding effective change.</li>
<li>Even when we see trends that we like, we may not know what is causing those trends. And, we may be afraid that the next change we might make will undo it.</li>
<li>It is also really demotivating to see trends we don’t like, and not know what is causing the problem.</li>
<li>We will use the sim UI to look at team trends 2 years into the future to answer <em>what if</em> questions about different decisions the team could make. What we’re doing today is that <em>looking back</em> using the data UI.
<a href="#DontLink"><img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/illustrations/data_ui_sim_ui.png?raw=true"></a></li>
<li>Simulation helps us to place a better initial bet about what is likely to pay off for our local Veteran community in terms of getting patients timely access to our highest quality care.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In-Session Exercise</strong></p>
<p><strong>Let’s get started!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Who would like to “drive” today?</strong> (Recommend the Team Lead)</p>
<p><strong>1. </strong>Open an internet browser window. Go to mtl.how/data. First select your VISN and then select your facility.**</p>
<ul>
<li>This will take you to the VA’s corporate data warehouse site, the Business Intelligence Service Line (or BISL), where you will log in with your VA email and PIV passcode. This site contains Protected Health Information (PHI), so as a provider you will be granted access according to the permissions that are set up on your PIV.</li>
<li>We’ll be opening the <em>Modeling to Learn</em> data user interface (UI) in Excel from here today.</li>
<li>We’ll show you how files you pull from here will be saved back to the secure site, so that you can protect patient PHI just as you do in all your work.</li>
<li>On the landing page, select your VISN. On the next page, select your team’s facility.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Explore the facility data.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To <strong>view facility data</strong> click on the […] next to the file <strong>“facility.xlsb”</strong> and click <strong>“Edit”</strong> to open in Excel.</li>
<li><strong>Team files are in team folders.</strong> If you do not see a team folder, click on <strong>"Request New Team Folder</strong> in the horizontal header next the BISL logo.</li>
<li>The facility data is designed to show trends relevant to your team vision of for the last two years. Let’s explore the information available in the facility data Excel spreadsheet:</li>

<p><strong>If the data is not loading or showing incorrect facilities/clinics, here’s how to refresh.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To <strong>refresh your facility file’s data</strong>, right click on any tab at the bottom of the Excel spreadsheet and select <strong>“Unhide…”</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>“Unhide sheet:”</strong> dropdown, select <strong>“Control”</strong> and click <strong>“OK”</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>“Control”</strong> tab, select your VA facility’s station number in the <strong>“Station:”</strong> dropdown and click <strong>“Refresh”</strong>.
<ul>
<li>Do not worry if you see your <strong>Excel worksheet become unresponsive as the data is refreshing and will take about 1-2 minutes to complete</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>As a warning, Do NOT click on “Propagate”</strong> as this is used by our data team to update facility data across the nation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To create a fresh data UI file, go through Steps #3-5. We will show you the steps but you already have a fresh data UI file.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Scroll to your team folder at the bottom of the page. Open the data_ui folder and open your data_ui file in Excel.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you do not have a data_ui file or need a newly updated one, copy the file in the Master_DataUI folder. This has a master data_UI file that has already been pre-selected for your facility/station.</li>
<li>Click on the 3 dots […] next to the data_ui file.</li>
<li>Click on “Edit” to open in Excel, then click “Edit Workbook” at the top of the sheet.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Go to the ClinicSelection tab. Use columns C-H to select the clinics that make up your team.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This data_ui file has already been specified for your facility/station.</li>
<li>You can sort by Clinic Name, Division Name, Physical Location, Primary Stopcode, Secondary Stopcode, and Default Provider.</li>
<li>Note that this will pull all clinics used in the last two years, including de-activated clinics (denoted by a “ZZ” prefix). You can also see the de-activated clinic’s inactivation date in column I.</li>
<li>Follow the instructions in <strong>Box A2</strong>.</li>
<li>After filtering, you can double-click on clinics to add them to column A, or you can highlight the clinics and click the gray “add all” button (Cell B6) to add them to column A.</li>
<li>In the future, if you want to quickly get the same list of clinics again, you can select the grey “Get previous clinic list from last click of Get Patient-level Data” arrow in Column B (Cell B3).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. To view your team patient data and your team trends click “Get Patient-level Data.” We will not do this in-session today.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You already have a fresh data UI file to work with in your data_ui folder. With your team lead (________), we selected the following clinics to represent your team.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>To query patient and clinic level data using the data_ui, you will need LSV permissions.</strong> To check which facilities you have LSV access for, click the <a href="https://spsites.cdw.va.gov/sites/PBM_AD/_layouts/15/ReportServer/RSViewerPage.aspx?rv%3aRelativeReportUrl=/sites/PBM_AD/AnalyticsReports/LSVAccessVerification.rdl">link</a> to access the document through VA intranet.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>If you don’t have access to facilities that you believe you should, please verify:</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>CPRS access/permissions at your station (i.e COR tab access for CPRS).</li>
<li>Your network username recorded in VistA. To have your network username recording in VistA, please follow the instructions outlined in the <a href="https://vaww.dev.fre.cdw.va.gov/sites/D05_VISN21/DashboardDevelopment/Updating%20Network%20UserName%20in%20VistA.aspx">linked document</a> through VA intranet.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>It takes some time to stitch together a “hyper-local” query tailored to your team from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse.</p></li>
<li><p>On average (depending on the size of your team) it may take 15 minutes or so for your team data UI to pull in fresh data. And, Microsoft Excel will be unresponsive until the data UI has finished pulling in your data.</p></li>
<li><p>**Prior to today’s session, __________________ [Team Lead’s name] worked with us to build an initial team dataset.<br />
</p></li>
<li><p><strong>__________________ [Team Lead’s name], which column did we find most helpful for creating this team’s dataset?</strong><br />
</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Are there any adjustments that the team would make to the clinic selection criteria? For example, should we include trainees? Other considerations that seem important?</strong></p></li>
<li><p>We will look at the <strong>“Create Team Data Table”</strong> button and its associated tab <strong>“SPReferrals”</strong> next time.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Click to view the “viz” tabs, which show team trends.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Just like the facility data, there are team trends for diagnoses, encounters, health factor data (e.g., suicide plans, evidence-based practice templates), and measures from mental health assistant. Your team’s vision was about _______________. Let’s go to the _________________ viz tab to see data relevant to that issue.</p></li>
<li><p>You can further drill up/down in the “viz” tabs by right clicking on any trend line and clicking on <strong>“Quick Explore<strong>" (look for the magnifying glass). In the </strong>”Explore“** box, pick the item you want to explore and click on <strong>"Drill To</strong>”. Keep using Quick Explore to drill until you reach the data you want. You can always click on the gray </strong>“Reset Pivot Chart”** button to return to the original settings.</p></li>
<li><p>The viz tabs will also always return to default selections every time the team clicks on “Get Patient-level Data” to refresh data in their data_ui file.</p></li>
<li><p>Note: If you use the “Quick Explore” drill down using patient names, all of the asterisked patients will be grouped together.</p></li>
<li><p>You can also right click on the line in a trend visualization and filter to hide a selected item or keep only the selected item.</p></li>
<li><p>vizDiag in the data UI shows a drill down by diagnoses or combination of diagnoses. For example, the “PTSD” line is for patients with only PTSD. The “PTSD &amp; AUD” line is for patients with both these diagnoses but does not discriminate between which is the primary, secondary, etc. diagnoses.</p></li>
<li><p>dataDiag in the data UI has an additional column after “Diagnoses of Interest,” called “Primary Diagnoses”. “Diagnoses of Interest” retains all the current unordered diagnoses combinations, while “Primary Diagnoses” indicates what is the primary diagnosis. This means that if there is only one diagnosis in the “Diagnoses of Interest” column, it will still repeat what that diagnosis is in the “Primary Diagnoses” column.</p>
<p><a href="#DontLink"><img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png?raw=true" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/></a> <strong><em>00:25-00:35</em></strong></p>

<li><strong>What is most important to you to check out first related to ________________________________</strong>(fill-in team vision)?
(Prepare in advance, but ask this as an open-ended question)?<br />

</ul>
<p><strong>7. Click to view the “data” tabs, which show your team’s individual patient information.</strong>
- Patients who have requested restricted access to their information have asterisks (****) in Column F &amp; G. If you are a VA provider, you can still identify patients from Column H.
- Patient information corresponds to the same categories as the team trends: diagnoses, encounters, health factor data (e.g., suicide plans, evidence-based practice templates), and measures from mental health assistant.
- Providers can filter to find specific patients, or produce reports.</p>

<p><strong>Learning Objectives</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Describe your team trends over the last two years based on the estimates in the team data table.</p></li>
<li><p>Test your understanding of how the team data are estimated by reviewing descriptions and definitions.</p></li>
<li><p>Apply your clinical expertise to consider the team trends in the data UI and team data table to identify team priorities for learning.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Let’s get started!</strong></p>
<p>As the graphic illustrates, we use the data UI to look back at team trends over the past two years - <em>what is</em>; and we will use the sim UI to look at team trends 2 years into the future to answer <em>what if</em> questions about different decisions the team could make.</p>
<p><strong>In-session Exercise (30 minutes): Team data table for simulation</strong></p>
<p><a href="#DontLink"><img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/illustrations/data_ui_sim_ui.png?raw=true"></a></p>
<p><strong>Navigate to the data UI at mtl.how/data.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You’ll log in with your VA credentials and you should have all the same permissions here as you do in general for your role in the VA.</li>
<li>Scroll down to your team folder. You should have two folders: data_ui and team_data_table. Click on the “data_ui” folder and open the Excel file.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Clicking the “Create Team Data Table” button produces a table of descriptive team data.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You already have a fresh Team Data Table file to work with in the team_data_table folder.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>It takes some time to generate a team data table for all modules using your team’s data.</p></li>
<li><p>On average (depending on the size of your team) it may take 15 minutes or so to generate a team data table. And, Microsoft Excel will be unresponsive until it is finished.</p></li>
<li><p>This is a different table from the one you generated last time by selecting the clinics that make up your team and then clicking “Get <em>Patient Level</em> Data.”</p></li>
<li><p>Data in this file are means, medians and percentages of key variables likely to influence the team’s priorities for learning from <em>Modeling to Learn</em>. Later on, we will upload this file to the sim UI so that it can <em>read in</em> these data, or parameters.</p></li>
<li><p>There are team data produced for each module of <em>Modeling to Learn</em>, each stored in its own tab:</p>
<ul>
<li>Care Coordination (CC) - tab title <em>CCParams</em></li>
<li>Medication Management (MM) - tab title <em>MMParams</em></li>
<li>Psychotherapy (PSY) - tab title <em>PSYParams</em></li>
<li>Aggregate mix of services (AGG) - tab title <em>AggParams</em></li>
<li>Measurement Based Stepped Care and Suicide Prevention (SP) - tab title <em>SPParams</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The patient cohort for each module is built by capturing all the unique patients who had a visit with the given team (from the user-supplied list of clinics/grids) within the correct encounter bin between 18 and 6 months ago. From that set of clinics, patients, and CPT codes, the data query then fetches all visits, no matter how long ago or how recent.</p>
<ul>
<li>In order to capture parameters that should be time-bound, such as new patients per week, the query can use that single year (e.g. from the patient cohort, how many were new to the team in the year that was used to build the cohort? Because that patient count captures all new patients over the year, we can just divide by 52 to get an average new patients per week).</li>
<li>For parameters that should not be time-bound, all the visits can be considered, so that some patients will correctly be fed into the model with many visits over years of engagement.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>We have already produced a team data table for you, but to do it yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select a set of clinics in <strong>ClinicSelection tab</strong> similar to what you did last session. In the future, you can pull up the same clinics used last time for creating the team data table by clicking on the gray “Get previous clinic list from Create Team Data Table file” button (Cell B4) to add them column A.</li>
<li>Additionally, if you want to produce team data for the <strong>SP module</strong>, click on the <strong>SPReferrals tab</strong>. Use this tab to select clinics that your team refers to/receives referrals from for the Suicide Prevention module. The data pull will track patients stepped up/down between your team and the one(s) you select. For example, if you are a GMH team, you would select “SMH” in the dropdown for “The clinics selected below that my team refers to are” and add the SMH clinics your team refers to in Column A. Once you have selected referral clinics in the <strong>SPReferrals tab</strong>, return to the “ClinicSelection” tab.</li>
<li>Click on the module drop-down. You can choose any module individually (CC, MM, PSY, AGG, SP), all modules without SP, or all modules including SP. If you are choosing “SP” or “all with SP”, make sure to do the previous steps using the <strong>SPReferrals tab</strong>.</li>
<li>Click on “Create Team Data Table”.</li>
<li>If you included SP in the module selection, three pop-ups will appear for the three possible care settings (GMH, SMH, PC/PCMHI) to indicate the threshold for minimum gap in patient care required for subsequent visit to be considered a new care episode. <em>In general for the (GMH or SMH or PC/PCMHI) setting, how long of a gap in patient care is required for the subsequent visit to be considered a new care episode? Set the threshold below in weeks. The default threshold is 39 weeks (9 months).</em></li>
<li>The team_data_table file you generate will automatically be saved into the team_data_table folder. Regardless of the module selection you make, the team_data_table file will include all five module tabs and labels, but will populate zeroes (“0”) for all parameters of modules that were <strong>not</strong> selected.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Navigate back to your team folder at mtl.how/data. Click on the “team_data_table” folder and open the Excel file to find the team data table already produced for you.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1. Select a module for review</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To show what data are used to tailor each <em>MTL</em> module to your team.
[Choose a module]<br />
</li>
<li><em>CCParams</em>: Key variables of interest in CC may include median engagement in weeks, appointment supply in appointments per week, return visit interval in weeks, starting rate in patients per week, and new patient wait times.</li>
<li><em>MMParams</em>: Key variables of interest in MM may include median engagement in weeks, appointment supply in appointments per week, return visit interval in weeks, starting rate in patients per week, and slots allocation percent for providers with and without an X waiver.</li>
<li><em>PSYParams</em>: Key variables that can be explored in PSY include median engagement duration and engagement after the patient’s first 3 months measured in weeks, appointment supply by service type (AUD, DEP, OUD, PTSD) within 3 months, and return visit interval after 3 months in weeks.</li>
<li><em>AggParams</em>: Key variables in AGG include median engagement in weeks, appointment supply by service type, return visit interval in weeks, new patient start rate (mean), and service proportions from team data.</li>
<li><em>SPParams</em>: In SP, key variables of interest may include high risk flag rates, engagement times before ending treatment in a specific setting, engagement time before stepping down or up between care settings, wait times, and the ratio of high to low symptom patients in each setting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out the different modules that are highlighted in the team data on the screen. As we review, we will use the mouse to highlight key team data variables.</p>
<ul>
<li>Find a variable that is important to your team. Look at how the variable is estimated in the table. Notice the units.</li>
<li>Where can you find even more detailed information about your team data? In each of these Params tabs, you can find more detailed information about your team data.</li>
<li>Check out the two columns to the right of the numerical data [show with mouse]. Let’s explore these two columns.
This column [highlight column] gives the description or definition of the variable.
This column [highlight column] contains additional details about how individual patient data are extracted and used to calculate your team’s historical trends.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Select a second module for review</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Check out the last 2 columns, to the right of the numerical data.
This column [highlight column] gives the description or definition of the variable.
This column [highlight column] contains additional details about how individual patient data are extracted and used to calculate your team’s historical trends.</li>
<li>Find a variable that is important to your team. How is it estimated in this table? What are its units?</li>
<li>Where can you find even more detailed information about your team data?
<ul>
<li>You can click on the “DataNotes” tab for a breakdown of how the patient cohort is defined, which CPT codes are used to define each service, and the patient engagement patterns (for the Psychotherapy module).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Are there any team data table values you would like to explore in the team data UI?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If so, which ones? Open the data UI to examine your question.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Does the team see any values in the team data that seem to vary significantly from expectations?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>If so, what is it surprising?</p></li>
<li><p>Does the estimation definition (second to last column, text in red) help you to interpret the variable value?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Does the team see any values in the team data that fit your expectations about high priority team needs?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>If so, what are you noticing?</p></li>
<li><p>In what ways does the team data fit with your day-to-day clinical practice in your team?</p></li>

<li>We encourage you to look around in the team data table before next time. Test whether you can find a piece of data you decide to look for. Just take a minute, if you can, to become familiar with the format and content of the data table. Remember, you can click through the Params tabs, one for each module, to dig into the details of how each parameter is calculated in the text columns to the right of the numerical data.</li>
<li>The next thing we ask is that each member of the team fill out a short form that you’ll find at mtl.how/menu. It will take about 12 minutes. Your responses will be confidential; no identifying information is collected.</li>
<li>We will aggregate the responses and consider them together in the next session to help the team choose which <em>MTL</em> module we’ll use for the next several sessions of <em>Modeling to Learn</em>.</li>
