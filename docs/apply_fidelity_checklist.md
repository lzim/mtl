Team: _______________________________________

Session: _______________________________________

### A. Post-Session Debriefing checklist items 1 & 3:

**1. Time management & trouble-shooting**

We achieved _________ (0-100%) of our time stamp marks as planned when we prioritized and practiced during our intersession prep.

**3. How did the co-facilitation model go? **

**Use the following Likert Scale for the Responses below**
- [ ] 5 Strongly Agree 
- [ ] 4 Agree 
- [ ] 3 Neither Agree nor Disagree 
- [ ] 2 Disagree 
- [ ] 1 Strongly Disagree

**Sessions 9-12 - Rate the following 4 items.** 
- [ ] 1. We helped the team consider the problem at hand as in terms of interconnection (Complex).
- [ ] 2. We helped the team look beyond a specific variable/output to determine the dynamic cause of the problem (Feedback).
- [ ] 3. We helped the team to consider how feedback produces important trends over time (System Behavior).
- [ ] 4. We helped the team to consider that a decision can have a different pattern of effects over time, depending on the state of the system (Time). 
- [ ] 5. We are supporting shared team decision-making in this project.

### B. Intersession checklist prioritizing Post-session Checklist items 6, 7 & 9 (short-form)

**6. What is the team's guiding question and hypotheses? (what are they testing?)**

**BUILD & APPLY (s9-12) Intersession Checklist Priorities**

_CONSIDER THESE QUESTIONS_

- **NEED: Current working conceptualization of this team's need based on the 4 priorities below?**  _______________________________________

- **DIFFERENTIATE: I need to rule in  _______________________________________ or rule out  _______________________________________ during this session to refine my conceptualization and prepare for the next session (based on growing consensus and capacity building with this team).**

- **My GOAL for this session is that the team will document the following Q/H/F/D by end of the session.**

**Question: _______________________________________** 

**Hypothesis: _______________________________________** 

**Findings: _______________________________________** 

**Decisions: _______________________________________** 

1. Specific values from the team data table (sessions 2,3 & 5) that are guiding the in-session work to address the team's highest priority need. _______________________________________

2. Complexity reveal (causal loop) most relevant to the team's highest priority need is: _______________________________________

3. Specific value adjustments you expect will be helpful for the team to experiment with related to their highest priority need: _______________________________________ 

**Experiment (Session)** | **Variable(s) & Value(s) in BC** | **Variable(s) and Value Adjustment(s) in Experiment**
-- | -- | -- 
**Exp 1 (s8)** | _______________________________________ | _______________________________________  
**Exp 2 (s9)** | _______________________________________  | _______________________________________ 
**Exp 3 (s10)** | _______________________________________  | _______________________________________ 

4. Output charts (system behaviors) you're going to check and discuss as a team in relation to their team's highest priority need: _______________________________________

**Sessions MTL focuses on improving systems thinking among frontline teams making care decisions.**

Systems Thinking | Definition
-- | -- 
Complex | **Forest not trees.**    Relationships among two or more   variables _______________________________________  [Tailor examples to the team: e.g., wait times, improvement rate], or two or more settings  _______________________________________  [Tailor examples to the team: e.g. primary   care, general mental health].
Feedback | **Loop not line.**    Not simple cause and effect. The end of   the story often influences the beginning, and is strengthened (reinforcing) _______________________________________ [Tailor to key reinforcing "systems story" for this team] or reduced (balancing) (reinforcing) _______________________________________ [Tailor to key balancing "systems story" for this team] around the loop.
System Behavior | **Movie not snapshot.**    Trends over time.    Systems cause their own behavior through feedback._______________________________________ [Tailor to team: Key system behavior output #1 for team] _______________________________________ [Tailor to team: Key system behavior output #2 for team] _______________________________________ [Tailor to team: Key system behavior output #3 for team] _______________________________________ [Tailor to team: Key system behavior output #4 for team] 
Time | **Short _and_ long term.**      Better understanding of change over   time   (e.g., worse before better, better   before worse)._______________________________________ [Tailor to team: System behavior output #1 pattern over next two years] _______________________________________ [Tailor to team: System behavior output #2 pattern over next two years] _______________________________________ [Tailor to team: System behavior output #3 pattern over next two years] _______________________________________ [Tailor to team: System behavior output #4 pattern over next two years]
