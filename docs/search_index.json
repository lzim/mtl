There are 3 intersession timestamp checklists used across the 12-session plan. Checklist Sessions 30-35 Minute Exercise Timestamp Script 1 Sessions 1-4 Participatory Learning 2 Sessions 5-10 Participatory Simulation Learning 3 Sessions 11-12 Wrap-up and Future Learning 3.1.3 C. How to “Prioritize” and “Practice” during the intersession: 3.1.4 Intersession Overview Identify team-tailored priorities based on the Modeling to Learn theory of change first. Then, fill in the session SAY guide, triaging what you will SAY, by narrowing down to what you’ve prioritized and practiced to fit within the timestamps below. Steps 1. Use the intersession guide to identify the team priorities you will practice. 2. Fill in the SAY guide for that session based on the priorities you identify. 3. Practice the highest priority tailoring to fit within the timestamps. 3.1.5 Intersession Purpose The intersession checklist is used by co-facilitators to ensure the goals and emphases of the MTL theory of change are prioritized and practiced when tailoring to your team’s highest priority need. The intersession checklist provides co-facilitator guidance for tailoring the MTL 12-session plan to their team. The intersession meeting uses the intersession checklist to prioritize and practice tailoring the SAY files to your team within the timestamps according to the MTL theory of change. Intersession preparation should help you to prioritize and practice key emphases of participatory learning and systems thinking related to the team’s priority need from session 1 through session 12 of the 12-session plan. 3.1.6 1. What you need Before you begin, you need to 1. Download or print the SAY checklist to fill in blanks for your team’s highest priority need. 2. Review post-session checklist notes especially #6 from the prior session. 3. Review the MTL Partner, Build, or Apply Fidelity Checklist to ensure high fidelity ratings. To complete the intersession checklist, you need to 1. Apply the 4 \"prioritize prompts from the intersession guide to the SAY file. 2. Clarify Co-Facilitator Roles - Choose a “Live Lead” - The live lead drives on-screen until handing off to the team lead. Choose a “Fidelity Facilitator” - The fidelity facilitator ensures that key goals and priorities are emphasized on-time to maintain fidelity.\" 3. Practice your priorities from the intersession guide using the intersession and SAY file timestamps. 3.1.7 2. Sessions 1-4 Goals and Emphases - Partner to identify the team’s highest priority learning need now. [participatory learning] Review the MTL Partner Fidelity Checklist and overview below. Introduce the overarching MTL Learning Objectives and identify a shared team vision for Modeling to Learn. Review hyper local transparent team data resources related to the team’s learning vision. Dialogue about the team’s highest priority learning need now using the MTL Menu Session Priority Participatory Learning s1 Shared Vision The team practices making team decisions as they move from an individual to shared vision, select their team lead and team meeting time s2 Team Data Trends The team learns to evaluate their own team data trends and patient data in relation to their team vision. s3 Team Data for Simulation The team selects the data that makes sense for their own context and shared vision, and builds the set of parameters they will use for “what if” simulation learning. s4 Team Need The team engages in a dialogue about the highest priority team need now, so that there is consensus around the MTL Learning Module selected for sessions 5-10. 3.1.8 3. Sessions 1-4 - Participatory Learning Timestamp Script 00:15 - Ideally no more than the first 5 minutes Done/Do Review - It’s ideal to keep the first Done/Do Review short to save more time for the In-session Exercise and the Done/Do at the end that shows, simple, short, specific (4’s) learning activities the team can do on their own between facilitated MTL team meetings. 3.1.8.1 Prepare, Prioritize and Practice 30-35 minutes of In-session Exercise During the Intersession Prep Meeting Time Stamp Prioritize tailored team learning Edit SAY checklist and practice 00:10-00:15 Cue up the “throughline” between the team’s learning vision, team data and team need question 6 from the Post-Session debrief. 00:15-00:20 Review to identify the themes from the team vision that should be highlighted in the team data. 1. In the SAY checklist, fill in the specific themes the team brought up when visioning during session 1. 00:20-00:25 Plan reflections for team responses to the prompt questions that relate to the team’s vision. 2. In the SAY checklist, fill in the specific values in the Team Data table (sessions 2 and 3) that reveal the team’s highest priority need. 00:25-00:35 Prioritize the answers to FAQs most related to the team’s need. 3a. In the SAY checklist, fill in the prioritized frequently asked questions (FAQs) and practice relating them to the team’s highest priority need. 00:35-00:40 Explain the participatory rationale for why teams’ can “drive” themselves and can access additional information or request updates related to the data. 3b. Practice explaining the reasons to empower the team with local transparent data resources. 00:40-00:50 Reflect with your co-facilitator double-check your thinking about the team’s relative consensus about their priorities before going to the MTL menu in session 4. 4. Prepare and practice reflections that synthesize a) multiple team member’s points of view, b) multiple variables that are related to one another (e.g., RVI and engagement duration), c) multiple problems that are likely related, and c) the “throughline” across learning sessions. 00:50-00:60 Success - A successful Done/Do Review is short, specific, simple and shown. 3.1.9 4. Sessions 5-8 Goals and Emphases - Build capacity for participatory learning from simulation using team question/hypothesis/findings/decisions. [participatory learning + systems thinking] Review the MTL Build Fidelity Checklist and overview below. Identify the new MTL capacities for each session consistent with the MTL theory of change. Tailor your review of new MTL resources and skills to the team’s highest priority need. Build team capacities to use MTL data and simulation resources without facilitation in the future. Target the next level of systems thinking for the team based on their question, hypothesis, findings and decisions boxes for that session. Session Capacity Participatory Learning + Systems Thinking s5 Experiments Section &amp; Text Enter the Team’s Learning Question based on the needs assessment and team data. s6 Tell a Systems Story Enter a Dynamic Hypothesis based on Systems story s7 Test a Dynamic Hypothesis Test the Dynamic Hypothesis for the Base Case and Write up the Findings and Decisions s8 Compare Alternatives Test Dynamic Hypothesis for an alternative and write up the comparison against the Basecase in Findings and Decisions. 3.1.10 5.

Sessions 9-12 Goals and Emphases - Use C.F.B.T. Systems Thinking and plan for future team learning needs and ready team to implement a tested change in the real world. [systems thinking] Review the MTL Apply Fidelity Checklist and overview below. Identify the new MTL capacities for each session consistent with the MTL theory of change. Target the next level of systems thinking for the team based on their question, hypothesis, findings and decisions boxes for that session, specifically these four C.F.B.T. systems thinking attributes: C.F.B.T. Systems Thinking Considers Complex Forest not trees. Relationships among two or more variables (wait times, improvement rate), or two or more settings (primary care, general mental health). Feedback Loop not line. Not simple cause and effect. The end of the story often influences the beginning, and is strengthened (reinforcing) or reduced (balancing) around the loop. System Behavior Movie not snapshot. Trends over time. Systems cause their own behavior through feedback. Time Short and long term. Better understanding of change over time (e.g., worse before better, better before worse). 3.1.12 7.

Summary of principles for team tailoring SAY guides in ways consistent with the MTL theory of change during the intersession. 3.1.13.1 Prioritize Align the team-specific tailoring with the goals and emphases of the sessions according the MTL Theory of Change. Prioritize continuity across sessions from the team vision, team data and team need. (MTL sessions 1-4). from session to session, (“last time we talked about…”; “so-and-so asked about…”). Clarify Co-Facilitator Roles - Choose a Live Lead and a Pre/Post Lead/Note-taker. 3.1.13.2 Practice Practice the highest priorities from the interesssion checklist - ensure they can be communicated to the time within the timestamps. - Prepare the specific examples and explanations tailored the team’s need, including the mousework and rationale in the SAY guide. - Practice to ensure your examples work within the time-frame. - Rehearse active listening skills. - Quiz each other on FAQ/anticipated questions from the team for the upcoming session. 3.2 MTL Partner Fidelity Checklist Sessions 1-4 (short-form) 3.2.1 Track the below session details and Section A at mtl.how/fidelity Team: _______________________________________ Session: _______________________________________ Date: _______________________________________ Live Lead: _______________________________________ Co-facilitator: _______________________________________ Rater: _______________________________________ 3.2.2 A.

Team Emails: 1) Done, 2) Do, 3) Decided 3.8 Debrief Examples 3.8.1 Team 1 What is the team’s guiding question and hypotheses? (what are they testing?) The vision coming out of this team is to improve the number of Veterans who get OUD therapy, without compromising the quality of care received by the team’s other patients. The team is really frustrated with their schedules, which are always too full to safely start more OUD patients (specifically not being sure they can get them in at the necessary 30 day interval). The team is feeling pretty burned out, often seeing patients during lunch, and never having enough time to chart and review complex patients. They are wondering whether sending some of their patients out for care in the community would be worth the trouble, if it means they can start treating more OUD. They are getting a lot of pressure from leadership to start more OUD patients, but don’t see any resources coming to support that change. One provider on the team voiced concern about the push to see more OUD patients and tht it was distracting people from their AUD patients, and those patients weren’t receiving the attention they should / used to get. After some back-and-forth, team settled on the shared vision of “Fight Opioid Addiction Now!” Team Emails: 1) Done, 2) Do, 3) Decided The team decided that Dr. O will be the team lead. The team meetings are monthly, during their team prep meeting on the 3rd Tuesday at 7:30AM Pacific. The shared team vision settled on is “Fight Opioid Addiction Now!” 3.8.2 Team 2 What is the team’s guiding question and hypotheses? (what are they testing?) Team is frustrated with wait times in psychotherapy. They are getting a lot of pressure to start more patients but can’t get patients into services. They want to improve the number of Veterans who get a course of psychotherapy and the quality of psychotherapy they get. They know a provider is going on maternity leave soon and are worried about the impact on their wait times. We don’t discuss patients often enough. We want to see some of our patients more often and don’t feel like we can get them scheduled in. Team Emails: 1) Done, 2) Do, 3) Decided The team decided that Dr. Klocek will be the team lead. The team meetings are on Fridays at 9:30AM Pacific. The team vision is R.E.S.P.E.C.T. which stands for “Really. Effective. Streamling. Patients. Evidence-based Clinical Treatment.” 3.8.3 Team 3 What is the team’s guiding question and hypotheses? (what are they testing?) They are frustrated with having too many patients and not enough time in the day to see them all. Feeling the pressure of having different types of patients with team members with different types of skills. Unclear how to function as a team and doesn’t feel like a team. Team feels schedule doesn’t allow them to do enough EBPsy &amp; EBPharm. Can’t get meds and psychotherarpy patients seen in a timely way. Have lots of groups slots but patients don’t want to come to that. Team Emails: 1) Done, 2) Do, 3) Decided The team decided that Dr. Smith will be the team lead. The team meetings are on Tuesday at 9:30AM Pacific. The shared team vision settled on is Shining the light to help you live your best life as we see and expand our best practices! 3.8.4 Team 4 What was covered during the meeting? The Learning Objectives of Modeling to Learn were discussed. The team struggled to identify a lot of positive shared learning experiences in their BHIP team in General Mental Health (GMH). Their individual visions included emphases about each providers frustrations with getting patients seen in a timely way, and being able to offer “top of license” care likely to get Veterans better. They joined around their frustration with referring their patients to another team: the Speciaty Mental Health programs locally are Addiction Treatment Services, Telehealth, and a PTSD Clinical Team. The PCT is their primary frustration. What were the team’s questions? (what did they ask?) They asked what the team lead does. They asked about research that informs Modeling to Learn. They asked if we had examples that Modeling to Learn had helped other clinics and how other clinics used MTL. They asked about whether the VANTS line and Adobe Connect link at https://mtl.how/live would be the same for the next meeting. What is the team’s guiding question and hypotheses? (what are they testing?) The vision coming out of this team is to improve the number of Veterans who get a course of psychotherapy in the GMH and local SMH programs and teams. The team is really frustrated with referring to SMH and has atually given up on making these referrals. They are wondering whether the MISSION Act will help They are frustrated that their Return-to-clinic Visit Intervals (RVI) are spread way out, so they don’t get patients better. They are angry with their SMH programs who have “protected” time to focus on EBPs, but won’t take their patients, which they believe reduces their SAIL scores and leads to a lot of conflicts with local leadership. The shared team vision settled on is R.E.S.P.E.C.T. which stands for “Really. Effective. Streamling. Patients. Evidence-based Clinical Treatment.” Team Emails: 1) Done, 2) Do, 3) Decided The team decided that Dr. Klocek will be the team lead. The team meetings are on Fridays at 9:30AM Pacific. The shared team vision settled on is R.E.S.P.E.C.T. which stands for “Really. Effective. Streamling. Patients.

While the Sim UI can manage most administrator-user needs within the web interface, sometimes it is necessary to go directly into Epicenter to, for example, set up a new end-user in Epicenter. Click Epicenter to go to the login. 8.7.1 Send Password Reset to End User 8.7.1.1 Select End User from Menu You can search for the user by using the search bar. 8.7.1.2 Click on the Password Reset You can also change the password directly for the user by selecting the “Change Password” from the dropdown. 8.7.2 Set up A New Epicenter End User 8.7.2.1 Navigate to A Project Note that you would navigate to various projects to set up end users in different instances of the Sim UI. For example, you would navigate to VA Sim UI-TEST-Slow to set an end-user up in the TEST environment. 8.7.2.2 Navigate to Group Page In the Epicenter hierarchy, “groups” are the highest entity. Underneath groups are worlds. In TeamPSD, we refer to groups as “teams.” Typically, we auto-setup a _team group and a _ind group to manage team assignments and individual worlds. 8.7.2.3 Select Desired Group 8.7.2.4 Click Add End User Button 8.7.2.5 Add User Email to Field and Click “Add/invite User” Button We usually put the user’s VA email address in this field. However, it does not have to be an email unless you are sending a notice via email to the user. Sometimes users just need an alias besides their email address. 8.7.3 Set up a team We don’t set up teams directly in Epicenter anymore, because there are multiple dependencies in the Sim UI that would be bypassed. See chapter 7.3 for more information about setting up a team on the Facilitator Dashboard. 8.7.4 Set up an Admin To set up an Admin, the end-user id must be assigned to the administrator_login group on the groups page.
