There are 3 intersession timestamp checklists used across the 12-session plan. Checklist Sessions 30-35 Minute Exercise Timestamp Script 1 Sessions 1-4 Participatory Learning 2 Sessions 5-10 Participatory Simulation Learning 3 Sessions 11-12 Wrap-up and Future Learning 3.1.3 C. How to “Prioritize” and “Practice” during the intersession: 3.1.4 Intersession Overview Identify team-tailored priorities based on the Modeling to Learn theory of change first. Then, fill in the session SAY guide, triaging what you will SAY, by narrowing down to what you’ve prioritized and practiced to fit within the timestamps below. Steps 1. Use the intersession guide to identify the team priorities you will practice. 2. Fill in the SAY guide for that session based on the priorities you identify. 3. Practice the highest priority tailoring to fit within the timestamps. 3.1.5 Intersession Purpose The intersession checklist is used by co-facilitators to ensure the goals and emphases of the MTL theory of change are prioritized and practiced when tailoring to your team’s highest priority need. The intersession checklist provides co-facilitator guidance for tailoring the MTL 12-session plan to their team. The intersession meeting uses the intersession checklist to prioritize and practice tailoring the SAY files to your team within the timestamps according to the MTL theory of change. Intersession preparation should help you to prioritize and practice key emphases of participatory learning and systems thinking related to the team’s priority need from session 1 through session 12 of the 12-session plan. 3.1.6 1. What you need Before you begin, you need to 1. Download or print the SAY checklist to fill in blanks for your team’s highest priority need. 2. Review post-session checklist notes especially #6 from the prior session. 3. Review the MTL Partner, Build, or Apply Fidelity Checklist to ensure high fidelity ratings. To complete the intersession checklist, you need to 1. Apply the 4 \"prioritize prompts from the intersession guide to the SAY file. 2. Clarify Co-Facilitator Roles - Choose a “Live Lead” - The live lead drives on-screen until handing off to the team lead. Choose a “Fidelity Facilitator” - The fidelity facilitator ensures that key goals and priorities are emphasized on-time to maintain fidelity.\" 3. Practice your priorities from the intersession guide using the intersession and SAY file timestamps. 3.1.7 2. Sessions 1-4 Goals and Emphases - Partner to identify the team’s highest priority learning need now. [participatory learning] Review the MTL Partner Fidelity Checklist and overview below. Introduce the overarching MTL Learning Objectives and identify a shared team vision for Modeling to Learn. Review hyper local transparent team data resources related to the team’s learning vision. Dialogue about the team’s highest priority learning need now using the MTL Menu Session Priority Participatory Learning s1 Shared Vision The team practices making team decisions as they move from an individual to shared vision, select their team lead and team meeting time s2 Team Data Trends The team learns to evaluate their own team data trends and patient data in relation to their team vision. s3 Team Data for Simulation The team selects the data that makes sense for their own context and shared vision, and builds the set of parameters they will use for “what if” simulation learning. s4 Team Need The team engages in a dialogue about the highest priority team need now, so that there is consensus around the MTL Learning Module selected for sessions 5-10. 3.1.8 3. Sessions 1-4 - Participatory Learning Timestamp Script 00:15 - Ideally no more than the first 5 minutes Done/Do Review - It’s ideal to keep the first Done/Do Review short to save more time for the In-session Exercise and the Done/Do at the end that shows, simple, short, specific (4’s) learning activities the team can do on their own between facilitated MTL team meetings. 3.1.8.1 Prepare, Prioritize and Practice 30-35 minutes of In-session Exercise During the Intersession Prep Meeting Time Stamp Prioritize tailored team learning Edit SAY checklist and practice 00:10-00:15 Cue up the “throughline” between the team’s learning vision, team data and team need question 6 from the Post-Session debrief. 00:15-00:20 Review to identify the themes from the team vision that should be highlighted in the team data. 1. In the SAY checklist, fill in the specific themes the team brought up when visioning during session 1. 00:20-00:25 Plan reflections for team responses to the prompt questions that relate to the team’s vision. 2. In the SAY checklist, fill in the specific values in the Team Data table (sessions 2 and 3) that reveal the team’s highest priority need. 00:25-00:35 Prioritize the answers to FAQs most related to the team’s need. 3a. In the SAY checklist, fill in the prioritized frequently asked questions (FAQs) and practice relating them to the team’s highest priority need. 00:35-00:40 Explain the participatory rationale for why teams’ can “drive” themselves and can access additional information or request updates related to the data. 3b. Practice explaining the reasons to empower the team with local transparent data resources. 00:40-00:50 Reflect with your co-facilitator double-check your thinking about the team’s relative consensus about their priorities before going to the MTL menu in session 4. 4. Prepare and practice reflections that synthesize a) multiple team member’s points of view, b) multiple variables that are related to one another (e.g., RVI and engagement duration), c) multiple problems that are likely related, and c) the “throughline” across learning sessions. 00:50-00:60 Success - A successful Done/Do Review is short, specific, simple and shown. 3.1.9 4. Sessions 5-8 Goals and Emphases - Build capacity for participatory learning from simulation using team question/hypothesis/findings/decisions. [participatory learning + systems thinking] Review the MTL Build Fidelity Checklist and overview below. Identify the new MTL capacities for each session consistent with the MTL theory of change. Tailor your review of new MTL resources and skills to the team’s highest priority need. Build team capacities to use MTL data and simulation resources without facilitation in the future. Target the next level of systems thinking for the team based on their question, hypothesis, findings and decisions boxes for that session. Session Capacity Participatory Learning + Systems Thinking s5 Experiments Section &amp; Text Enter the Team’s Learning Question based on the needs assessment and team data. s6 Tell a Systems Story Enter a Dynamic Hypothesis based on Systems story s7 Test a Dynamic Hypothesis Test the Dynamic Hypothesis for the Base Case and Write up the Findings and Decisions s8 Compare Alternatives Test Dynamic Hypothesis for an alternative and write up the comparison against the Basecase in Findings and Decisions. 3.1.10 5.

Sessions 9-12 Goals and Emphases - Use C.F.B.T. Systems Thinking and plan for future team learning needs and ready team to implement a tested change in the real world. [systems thinking] Review the MTL Apply Fidelity Checklist and overview below. Identify the new MTL capacities for each session consistent with the MTL theory of change. Target the next level of systems thinking for the team based on their question, hypothesis, findings and decisions boxes for that session, specifically these four C.F.B.T. systems thinking attributes: C.F.B.T. Systems Thinking Considers Complex Forest not trees. Relationships among two or more variables (wait times, improvement rate), or two or more settings (primary care, general mental health). Feedback Loop not line. Not simple cause and effect. The end of the story often influences the beginning, and is strengthened (reinforcing) or reduced (balancing) around the loop. System Behavior Movie not snapshot. Trends over time. Systems cause their own behavior through feedback. Time Short and long term. Better understanding of change over time (e.g., worse before better, better before worse). 3.1.12 7.

Summary of principles for team tailoring SAY guides in ways consistent with the MTL theory of change during the intersession. 3.1.13.1 Prioritize Align the team-specific tailoring with the goals and emphases of the sessions according the MTL Theory of Change. Prioritize continuity across sessions from the team vision, team data and team need. (MTL sessions 1-4). from session to session, (“last time we talked about…”; “so-and-so asked about…”). Clarify Co-Facilitator Roles - Choose a Live Lead and a Pre/Post Lead/Note-taker. 3.1.13.2 Practice Practice the highest priorities from the interesssion checklist - ensure they can be communicated to the time within the timestamps. - Prepare the specific examples and explanations tailored the team’s need, including the mousework and rationale in the SAY guide. - Practice to ensure your examples work within the time-frame. - Rehearse active listening skills. - Quiz each other on FAQ/anticipated questions from the team for the upcoming session. 3.2 MTL Partner Fidelity Checklist Sessions 1-4 (short-form) 3.2.1 Track the below session details and Section A at mtl.how/fidelity Team: _______________________________________ Session: _______________________________________ Date: _______________________________________ Live Lead: _______________________________________ Co-facilitator: _______________________________________ Rater: _______________________________________ 3.2.2 A.

Team Emails: 1) Done, 2) Do, 3) Decided 3.8 Debrief Examples 3.8.1 Team 1 What is the team’s guiding question and hypotheses? (what are they testing?) The vision coming out of this team is to improve the number of Veterans who get OUD therapy, without compromising the quality of care received by the team’s other patients. The team is really frustrated with their schedules, which are always too full to safely start more OUD patients (specifically not being sure they can get them in at the necessary 30 day interval). The team is feeling pretty burned out, often seeing patients during lunch, and never having enough time to chart and review complex patients. They are wondering whether sending some of their patients out for care in the community would be worth the trouble, if it means they can start treating more OUD. They are getting a lot of pressure from leadership to start more OUD patients, but don’t see any resources coming to support that change. One provider on the team voiced concern about the push to see more OUD patients and tht it was distracting people from their AUD patients, and those patients weren’t receiving the attention they should / used to get. After some back-and-forth, team settled on the shared vision of “Fight Opioid Addiction Now!” Team Emails: 1) Done, 2) Do, 3) Decided The team decided that Dr. O will be the team lead. The team meetings are monthly, during their team prep meeting on the 3rd Tuesday at 7:30AM Pacific. The shared team vision settled on is “Fight Opioid Addiction Now!” 3.8.2 Team 2 What is the team’s guiding question and hypotheses? (what are they testing?) Team is frustrated with wait times in psychotherapy. They are getting a lot of pressure to start more patients but can’t get patients into services. They want to improve the number of Veterans who get a course of psychotherapy and the quality of psychotherapy they get. They know a provider is going on maternity leave soon and are worried about the impact on their wait times. We don’t discuss patients often enough. We want to see some of our patients more often and don’t feel like we can get them scheduled in. Team Emails: 1) Done, 2) Do, 3) Decided The team decided that Dr. Klocek will be the team lead. The team meetings are on Fridays at 9:30AM Pacific. The team vision is R.E.S.P.E.C.T. which stands for “Really. Effective. Streamling. Patients. Evidence-based Clinical Treatment.” 3.8.3 Team 3 What is the team’s guiding question and hypotheses? (what are they testing?) They are frustrated with having too many patients and not enough time in the day to see them all. Feeling the pressure of having different types of patients with team members with different types of skills. Unclear how to function as a team and doesn’t feel like a team. Team feels schedule doesn’t allow them to do enough EBPsy &amp; EBPharm. Can’t get meds and psychotherarpy patients seen in a timely way. Have lots of groups slots but patients don’t want to come to that. Team Emails: 1) Done, 2) Do, 3) Decided The team decided that Dr. Smith will be the team lead. The team meetings are on Tuesday at 9:30AM Pacific. The shared team vision settled on is Shining the light to help you live your best life as we see and expand our best practices! 3.8.4 Team 4 What was covered during the meeting? The Learning Objectives of Modeling to Learn were discussed. The team struggled to identify a lot of positive shared learning experiences in their BHIP team in General Mental Health (GMH). Their individual visions included emphases about each providers frustrations with getting patients seen in a timely way, and being able to offer “top of license” care likely to get Veterans better. They joined around their frustration with referring their patients to another team: the Speciaty Mental Health programs locally are Addiction Treatment Services, Telehealth, and a PTSD Clinical Team. The PCT is their primary frustration. What were the team’s questions? (what did they ask?) They asked what the team lead does. They asked about research that informs Modeling to Learn. They asked if we had examples that Modeling to Learn had helped other clinics and how other clinics used MTL. They asked about whether the VANTS line and Adobe Connect link at https://mtl.how/live would be the same for the next meeting. What is the team’s guiding question and hypotheses? (what are they testing?) The vision coming out of this team is to improve the number of Veterans who get a course of psychotherapy in the GMH and local SMH programs and teams. The team is really frustrated with referring to SMH and has atually given up on making these referrals. They are wondering whether the MISSION Act will help They are frustrated that their Return-to-clinic Visit Intervals (RVI) are spread way out, so they don’t get patients better. They are angry with their SMH programs who have “protected” time to focus on EBPs, but won’t take their patients, which they believe reduces their SAIL scores and leads to a lot of conflicts with local leadership. The shared team vision settled on is R.E.S.P.E.C.T. which stands for “Really. Effective. Streamling. Patients. Evidence-based Clinical Treatment.” Team Emails: 1) Done, 2) Do, 3) Decided The team decided that Dr. Klocek will be the team lead. The team meetings are on Fridays at 9:30AM Pacific. The shared team vision settled on is R.E.S.P.E.C.T. which stands for “Really. Effective. Streamling. Patients.

To view your team patient data and your team trends click “Get Patient-level Data.” We will not do this in-session today. You already have a fresh data UI file to work with in your team data_ui folder. We will learn about the “Create Team Data Table” button in our next team meeting. To query patient and clinic level data using the data_ui, you will need LSV permissions. To check which facilities you have LSV access for, click here (VA intranet only). If you don’t have access to facilities that you believe you should, please verify: CPRS access/permissions at your station (i.e COR tab access for CPRS). Your network username recorded in VistA. To have your network username recording in VistA, please follow the instructions outlined here (VA intranet only). NOTE: It takes some time to run a query from your team data UI to the VA Corporate Data Warehouse. On average (depending on the size of your team) it may take 15 minutes or so for your team data UI to pull in fresh data, and Microsoft Excel will be unresponsive until the data UI has finished pulling in your data. 6. Click to view the “viz” tab, which show team trends. There are team trends for diagnoses, encounters, health factor data (e.g., suicide plans, evidence-based practice templates), and measures from Mental Health Assistant. What stands out to you? What is most important to you to check out first? What is most surprising? Click on any trend line and then “Quick Explore” (look for the magnifying glass). In the “Explore” box, pick the item you want to explore and click “Drill To.” Keep using the Quick Explore to drill until you reach the data you want. To return to the original settings, click on the gray “Reset Pivot Chart.” The viz tabs will also return to default selections, when you click “Get Patient-level Data” for new data pulls. Right click on a trend line and filter to hide a selected item or only keep the selected item. vizDiag in the data UI shows a drill down by diagnoses or combination of diagnoses. For Veterans Video Connect (VVC), use the VVC filter in the vizEnc tab. 7. Click to view the “data” tab, which show your team’s individual patient information. Patients who have requested restricted access to their information have asterisks (****) in Columns F &amp; G. If you are a VA provider, you can still identify patients from Column H. Patient information corresponds to the same categories as the team trends: diagnoses, encounters, health factor data (e.g., suicide plans, evidence-based practice templates), and measures from Mental Health Assistant. Providers can filter to find specific patients, or produce reports. dataDiag in the data UI has an additional column after “Diagnoses of Interest,” called “Primary Diagnoses”, specifying which diagnosis is primary. What data tab would you use to find out how many current patients on the team are engaged in a specific evidence-based psychotherapy? What column shows you the session number (EBP template) that the patient is on? What viz option would you use to see what the most common service encounters or visits are? Are there services that have been increasing over time? Are there services that have been decreasing over time? With the team trends (viz) and team patient (data) information in the data UI, your team can efficiently use team meetings to focus on the interrelated issues of care coordination and team quality improvement. Done and Do (15 minutes) Done Do We selected the clinics that make up our team for the Team Data UI. Review the HF, Diag, Enc and SP tabs in Team Data UI to find a patient (zoom in) and find a team trend (zoom out). Log in to mtl.how/data and look at the two team folders: data_ui and team_data_table. 4.1.1.1 MTL Data Cheatsheet 4.1.2 Part 02 See Guide Today we’re modeling to learn how to calculate team parameters. Done and Do (15 minutes) Done Do We reviewed the HF, Diag, Enc and SP tabs in Team Data to find a patient and a team trend. We logged in to mtl.how/data and looked at the two team folders: data_ui and team_data_table. We will examine calculated team parameters for CC, MM, PSY, AGG, and SP. Learning Objectives Describe your team trends over the last two years based on the estimates in the team data table. Test your understanding of how the team data are estimated by reviewing descriptions and definitions. Apply your clinical expertise to consider the team trends in the data UI and team data table to identify team priorities for learning. In-session Exercise (30 minutes) When you click the “Create Team Data Table” button, it produces a table of descriptive team data. We will not do this in-session today. You already have a fresh Team Data Table to work with in your team_data_table folder. Data are means, medians and percentages of key variables likely to influence the team’s priorities for learning from Modeling to Learn There are team data produced for each module of Modeling to Learn Care Coordination (CC) Medication Management (MM) Psychotherapy (PSY) Aggregate team services (AGG) Measurement-based stepped care and suicide prevention (SP) Select a set of clinics in ClinicSelection tab similar to what you did for the data UI. In the future, if you would like to use the same clinic selections for pulling new parameters, you can select the “Get previous clinic list from Create Team Data Table file” arrow in Column B (Cell B4). If you want to produce a team data table for the SP module, click on the SPReferrals tab. Use this tab to select clinics that your team refers to/receives referrals from for the Measurement Based Stepped Care and Suicide Prevention module. The data pull will track patients stepped up/down between your team and the one(s) you select. For example, if you are a GMH team, you would select “SMH” in the dropdown for “The clinics selected below that my team refers to are” and add the SMH clinics your team refers to in Column A. Once you have selected referral clinics in the SPReferrals tab, return to the “ClinicSelection” tab. Click on the module drop-down to select the module you want and select “Create Team Data Table.” You can generate a team data table for each of the modules individually, all the modules without SP (called “All without SP”), or all the modules with SP (called “All with SP”). - When you select a team data table option for specific modules, the team_data_table file you generate will have all five module tabs and labels, but will populate 0s for all other parameters that were not selected. If you included SP in the module selection, three pop-ups will appear for the three possible care settings (GMH, SMH, PC/PCMHI) to indicate the threshold for minimum gap in patient care required for subsequent visit to be considered a new care episode. In general for the (GMH or SMH or PC/PCMHI) setting, how long of a gap in patient care is required for the subsequent visit to be considered a new care episode? Set the threshold below in weeks. The default threshold is 39 weeks (9 months). 1. Select a module for review Find a variable that is important to your team. How is it estimated in this table? What are its units? Where can you find even more detailed information about your team data? Check out the last two columns. What is the difference between these two columns? 2. Select a second module for review Check out the last two columns. Find a variable that is important to you team. How is it estimated in this table? What are its units? Where can you find even more detailed information about your team data? 3. Are there any team data table values you would like to explore in the team data UI? If so, which ones? Open the data UI to examine your question. 4. Does the team see any values in the team data that seem to vary significantly from expectations? If so, what is surprising? Does the estimation definition (second to last column, text in red) help you to interpret the variable value? 5. Does the team see any values in the team data that fit your expectations about high priority team needs? If so, what are you noticing? In what ways does the team data fit with your day-to-day clinical practice in your team? Done and Do (15 minutes) Done Do We examined team parameters for CC, MM, PSY, AGG, and SP. Find something in the team data table and consider its implications for team decisions. 4.2 Facilitator 4.2.1 Part 01 Say Guide Hello! I’m ______ and I’m ______.

If you do not see a team folder, click on \"Request New Team Folder in the horizontal header next the BISL logo. The facility data is designed to show trends relevant to your team vision of __________________________ for the last two years. Let’s explore the information available in the facility data Excel spreadsheet. There are two types of View options at the bottom of the spreadsheet. __________________ [Team Lead’s name] Will you please click through them, so we can see what each displays? View Displays Count (in Viz tabs) Count tables that match the viz graphs Data Sortable report of de-identified individual patient data Viz Visualization of trends over time. There are four main data sets in the facility data: [During intersession prep, facilitator should fill-in the rankings of the highest priority data categories that should be emphasized. Follow the team’s lead “live” during the meeting, but be prepared.] Rank Data Displays ___ Diag Primary diagnosis only on visits in that setting level. (Note: In DataDiag, unique visits are shown, since each visit can only have one primary diagnosis. For more detail, open up the data UI.) ___ Enc Encounter or visits types, such as medication management, psychotherapy, intakes etc. ___ HF Health Factors data related to visits, including evidence-based psychotherapy templates, and other clinical reminders and screenings. ___ Meas Standardized symptom scales, such as the PHQ-9 for depression or PCL-5 for PTSD, and suicide and behavioral risk flags. To sum up, there are three ways to view each set of data: Counts per month: countDiag, countEnc, countHF, and countMeas; Visual charts of trends over time: vizDiag, vizEnc, vizHF, and vizMeas Drill down patient-level data: dataDiag, dataHF, and dataMeas. 00:20-00:25 All data is sortable and filterable so that the team can transparently see how the charting you do all day becomes VA data.

To refresh your facility file’s data, right click on any tab at the bottom of the Excel spreadsheet and select “Unhide…”. In the “Unhide sheet:” dropdown, select “Control” and click “OK”. In the “Control” tab, select your VA facility’s station number in the “Station:” dropdown and click “Refresh”. Do not worry if you see your Excel worksheet become unresponsive as the data is refreshing and will take about 1-2 minutes to complete. As a warning, Do NOT click on “Propagate” as this is used by our data team to update facility data across the nation. To create a fresh data UI file, go through Steps #3-5. We will show you the steps but you already have a fresh data UI file. 3. Scroll to your team folder at the bottom of the page. Open the data_ui folder and open your data_ui file in Excel. If you do not have a data_ui file or need a newly updated one, copy the file in the Master_DataUI folder. This has a master data_UI file that has already been pre-selected for your facility/station. Click on the 3 dots […] next to the data_ui file. Click on “Edit” to open in Excel, then click “Edit Workbook” at the top of the sheet. 4. Go to the ClinicSelection tab. Use columns C-H to select the clinics that make up your team. This data_ui file has already been specified for your facility/station. You can sort by Clinic Name, Division Name, Physical Location, Primary Stopcode, Secondary Stopcode, and Default Provider. Note that this will pull all clinics used in the last two years, including de-activated clinics (denoted by a “ZZ” prefix). You can also see the de-activated clinic’s inactivation date in column I. Follow the instructions in Box A2. After filtering, you can double-click on clinics to add them to column A, or you can highlight the clinics and click the gray “add all” button (Cell B6) to add them to column A. In the future, if you want to quickly get the same list of clinics again, you can select the grey “Get previous clinic list from last click of Get Patient-level Data” arrow in Column B (Cell B3). 5. To view your team patient data and your team trends click “Get Patient-level Data.” We will not do this in-session today. You already have a fresh data UI file to work with in your data_ui folder. With your team lead (________), we selected the following clinics to represent your team. To query patient and clinic level data using the data_ui, you will need LSV permissions. To check which facilities you have LSV access for, click the link to access the document through VA intranet. If you don’t have access to facilities that you believe you should, please verify: CPRS access/permissions at your station (i.e COR tab access for CPRS). Your network username recorded in VistA. To have your network username recording in VistA, please follow the instructions outlined in the linked document through VA intranet. It takes some time to stitch together a “hyper-local” query tailored to your team from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse. On average (depending on the size of your team) it may take 15 minutes or so for your team data UI to pull in fresh data. And, Microsoft Excel will be unresponsive until the data UI has finished pulling in your data. **Prior to today’s session, __________________ [Team Lead’s name] worked with us to build an initial team dataset. __________________ [Team Lead’s name], which column did we find most helpful for creating this team’s dataset? Are there any adjustments that the team would make to the clinic selection criteria? For example, should we include trainees? Other considerations that seem important? We will look at the “Create Team Data Table” button and its associated tab “SPReferrals” next time. 6. Click to view the “viz” tabs, which show team trends. Just like the facility data, there are team trends for diagnoses, encounters, health factor data (e.g., suicide plans, evidence-based practice templates), and measures from mental health assistant. Your team’s vision was about [ __]. Let’s go to the [__ ] viz tab to see data relevant to that issue. You can further drill up/down in the “viz” tabs by right clicking on any trend line and clicking on “Quick Explore\" (look for the magnifying glass). In the ”Explore“** box, pick the item you want to explore and click on \"Drill To”. Keep using Quick Explore to drill until you reach the data you want. You can always click on the gray “Reset Pivot Chart”** button to return to the original settings. The viz tabs will also always return to default selections every time the team clicks on “Get Patient-level Data” to refresh data in their data_ui file. Note: If you use the “Quick Explore” drill down using patient names, all of the asterisked patients will be grouped together. You can also right click on the line in a trend visualization and filter to hide a selected item or keep only the selected item. vizDiag in the data UI shows a drill down by diagnoses or combination of diagnoses. For example, the “PTSD” line is for patients with only PTSD. The “PTSD &amp; AUD” line is for patients with both these diagnoses but does not discriminate between which is the primary, secondary, etc. diagnoses. dataDiag in the data UI has an additional column after “Diagnoses of Interest,” called “Primary Diagnoses”. “Diagnoses of Interest” retains all the current unordered diagnoses combinations, while “Primary Diagnoses” indicates what is the primary diagnosis. This means that if there is only one diagnosis in the “Diagnoses of Interest” column, it will still repeat what that diagnosis is in the “Primary Diagnoses” column. To filter by Veterans Video Connect, known as VVC, use the grey VVC filter button in the top left hand corner of the visualization in the vizEnc tab. 00:25-00:35 What stands out to you about ________________________________[fill-in team vision]**? What is most important to you to check out first related to ________________________________[fill-in team vision]? [Prepare in advance, but ask this as an open-ended question]? What is most surprising? [Prepare in advance, but ask this as an open-ended question]? 00:35-00:40 7. Click to view the “data” tabs, which show your team’s individual patient information. Patients who have requested restricted access to their information have asterisks (****) in Column F &amp; G. If you are a VA provider, you can still identify patients from Column H. Patient information corresponds to the same categories as the team trends: diagnoses, encounters, health factor data (e.g., suicide plans, evidence-based practice templates), and measures from mental health assistant. Providers can filter to find specific patients, or produce reports. 00:40-00:50 [During intersession prep facilitator should fill-in the rankings of the highest priority viz that should be emphasized during the team meeting. Follow the team’s lead “live” during the meeting, but be prepared.] Time Stamp Team Learning Priorities Script Prioritize which questions you will use given this team’s guiding vision. Keep an eye on time Themes from the team vision to be highlighted. Team Data related questions to Prioritize with the Team.

All the patient-level data are identified with patient names. You can create parameters that represent averages or medians for the team over the past two years. Review your individual patient data and identify team trends: Health Factors (HF) Diagnoses (Diag) Encounters (Enc), and Measurement Based Stepped Care and Suicide Prevention (SP) Until next time, thank you for Modeling to Learn! 4.2.1.1 Facilitator One Pager 4.2.2 Part 02 Say Guide Hello! I’m _______ and I’m _______. Today we’re modeling to learn how to calculate team parameters. Done and Do (15 minutes) Done Do We reviewed the HF, Diag, Enc and SP tabs in Team Data to find a patient and a team trend. We logged in to mtl.how/data and looked at the two team folders: data_ui and team_data_table. We will examine calculated team parameters for CC, MM, PSY, AGG, and SP. Learning Objectives After this session, you will be able to: Describe your team trends over the last two years based on the estimates in the team data table. Test your understanding of how the team data are estimated by reviewing descriptions and definitions. Apply your clinical expertise to consider the team trends in the data UI and team data table to identify team priorities for learning. In-session Exercise (30 minutes) Let’s get started! Who would like to “drive” today? [Recommend the Team Lead] Navigate to the data UI at mtl.how/data You’ll log in with your VA credentials and you should have all the same permissions here as you do in general for your role in the VA. Scroll down to your team folder. You should have two folders: data_ui and team_data_table. Click on the “data_ui” folder and open the Excel file. Clicking the “Create Team Data Table” button produces a table of descriptive team data. You already have a fresh Team Data Table file to work with in the team_data_table folder. It takes some time to generate a team data table for all modules using your team’s data. On average (depending on the size of your team) it may take 15 minutes or so to generate a team data table. And, Microsoft Excel will be unresponsive until it is finished. This is a different table from the one you generated last time by selecting the clinics that make up your team and then clicking “Get Patient Level Data.” Data in this file are means, medians and percentages of key variables likely to influence the team’s priorities for learning from Modeling to Learn. There are team data produced for each module of Modeling to Learn, each stored in its own tab: Care Coordination (CC) - tab title CCParams Medication Management (MM) - tab title MMParams Psychotherapy (PSY) - tab title PSYParams Aggregate mix of services (AGG) - tab title AggParams Measurement Based Stepped Care and Suicide Prevention (SP) - tab title SPParams The patient cohort for each module is built by capturing all the unique patients who had a visit with the given team (from the user-supplied list of clinics/grids) within the correct encounter bin between 18 and 6 months ago. From that set of clinics, patients, and CPT codes, the data query then fetches all visits, no matter how long ago or how recent. In order to capture parameters that should be time-bound, such as new patients per week, the query can use that single year (e.g. from the patient cohort, how many were new to the team in the year that was used to build the cohort? Because that patient count captures all new patients over the year, we can just divide by 52 to get an average new patients per week). For parameters that should not be time-bound, all the visits can be considered, so that some patients will correctly be fed into the model with many visits over years of engagement. We have already produced a team data table for you, but to do it yourself: Select a set of clinics in ClinicSelection tab similar to what you did last session. In the future, you can pull up the same clinics used last time for creating the team data table by clicking on the gray “Get previous clinic list from Create Team Data Table file” button (Cell B4) to add them column A. Additionally, if you want to produce team data for the SP module, click on the SPReferrals tab. Use this tab to select clinics that your team refers to/receives referrals from for the Suicide Prevention module. The data pull will track patients stepped up/down between your team and the one(s) you select. For example, if you are a GMH team, you would select “SMH” in the dropdown for “The clinics selected below that my team refers to are” and add the SMH clinics your team refers to in Column A. Once you have selected referral clinics in the SPReferrals tab, return to the “ClinicSelection” tab. Click on the module drop-down. You can choose any module individually (CC, MM, PSY, AGG, SP), all modules without SP, or all modules including SP. If you are choosing “SP” or “all with SP”, make sure to do the previous steps using the SPReferrals tab. Click on “Create Team Data Table”. If you included SP in the module selection, three pop-ups will appear for the three possible care settings (GMH, SMH, PC/PCMHI) to indicate the threshold for minimum gap in patient care required for subsequent visit to be considered a new care episode. In general for the (GMH or SMH or PC/PCMHI) setting, how long of a gap in patient care is required for the subsequent visit to be considered a new care episode? Set the threshold below in weeks. The default threshold is 39 weeks (9 months). The team_data_table file you generate will automatically be saved into the team_data_table folder. Regardless of the module selection you make, the team_data_table file will include all five module tabs and labels, but will populate zeroes (“0”) for all parameters of modules that were not selected. Navigate back to your team folder at mtl.how/data. Click on the “team_data_table” folder and open the Excel file to find the team data table already produced for you. 1. Select a module for review To show what data are used to tailor each MTL module to your team. [Choose a module] CCParams: Key variables of interest in CC may include median engagement in weeks, appointment supply in appointments per week, return visit interval in weeks, starting rate in patients per week, and new patient wait times. MMParams: Key variables of interest in MM may include median engagement in weeks, appointment supply in appointments per week, return visit interval in weeks, starting rate in patients per week, and slots allocation percent for providers with and without an X waiver. PSYParams: Key variables that can be explored in PSY include median engagement duration and engagement after the patient’s first 3 months measured in weeks, appointment supply by service type (AUD, DEP, OUD, PTSD) within 3 months, and return visit interval after 3 months in weeks. AggParams: Key variables in AGG include median engagement in weeks, appointment supply by service type, return visit interval in weeks, new patient start rate (mean), and service proportions from team data. SPParams: In SP, key variables of interest may include high risk flag rates, engagement times before ending treatment in a specific setting, engagement time before stepping down or up between care settings, wait times, and the ratio of high to low symptom patients in each setting. Check out the different modules that are highlighted in the team data on the screen. As we review, we will use the mouse to highlight key team data variables. Find a variable that is important to your team. Look at how the variable is estimated in the table. Notice the units. Where can you find even more detailed information about your team data? In each of these Params tabs, you can find more detailed information about your team data. Check out the two columns to the right of the numerical data [show with mouse]. Let’s explore these two columns. This column [highlight column] gives the description or definition of the variable. This column [highlight column] contains additional details about how individual patient data are extracted and used to calculate your team’s historical trends. 2. Select a second module for review Check out the last 2 columns, to the right of the numerical data. This column [highlight column] gives the description or definition of the variable. This column [highlight column] contains additional details about how individual patient data are extracted and used to calculate your team’s historical trends. Find a variable that is important to your team. How is it estimated in this table? What are its units? Where can you find even more detailed information about your team data? You can click on the “DataNotes” tab for a breakdown of how the patient cohort is defined, which CPT codes are used to define each service, and the patient engagement patterns (for the Psychotherapy module). 3. Are there any team data table values you would like to explore in the team data UI? If so, which ones? Open the data UI to examine your question. 4. Does the team see any values in the team data that seem to vary significantly from expectations? If so, what is it surprising? Does the estimation definition (second to last column, text in red) help you to interpret the variable value? 5. Does the team see any values in the team data that fit your expectations about high priority team needs? If so, what are you noticing? In what ways does the team data fit with your day-to-day clinical practice in your team? That’s it for Modeling to learn how to calculate team parameters. Next is our Done/Do review Done and Do (15 minutes) Done Do We examined team parameters for CC, MM, PSY, AGG, and SP. Find something in the team data table and consider its implications for team decisions. DO demo We encourage you to look around in the team data table before next time. Test whether you can find a piece of data you decide to look for. Just take a minute, if you can, to become familiar with the format and content of the data table. Remember, you can click through the Params tabs, one for each module, to dig into the details of how each parameter is calculated in the text columns to the right of the numerical data.

Learning Objectives Describe your own vision for what you would like your team to get from Modeling to Learn. Test out your thinking with your team about what your shared vision is for becoming a “dream team.” Identify a shared team vision for learning from Modeling to Learn. In-session Exercise (30 minutes) 1. Prior Team Learning Prompt (5 minutes) Think of a good learning experience in your team. It can be in a meeting or an informal exchange with a colleague. It can be when you learned a clinic procedure, an idea for treatment with a difficult patient, or when a team member unlocked a mystery of CPRS for you. Try to think of a time when you had an ‘aha!’ or something finally made sense, or you could finally do something you couldn’t before. Jot down on scratch paper what it was that made it a good learning experience. What were the characteristics of the experience? Compile a team list: Most likely the following are true:* The learning was hands-on and experiential. The learning connected to the real world. The learning experience was personally relevant, interesting, useful, or meaningful to the learner. The learner had choices, shared authority, control, and responsibility. The learner learned from and taught others. The learner had the support he or she needed. The learning was individualized. If there were standards for the work, the learner could meet them in his or her own way. It was fun or left the learner feeling good. The experience helped the learner understand him- or herself. The learner experienced success and accomplishment with challenging work. 2. Best Case Scenario (5 minutes) Create team language for learning, aligning team decisions when there are roadblocks to consensus. Start by picturing Veteran mental health care in this team as you experience it now – the interactions/communications within the team in and out of team meetings; the key people you rely on outside the team; the information and data you use to coordinate care plans, and the feelings you associate with it. Now picture the team learning over the next 6 months in a ‘best-case’ scenario, where things are happening in the team the way that you would ideally like them to. This is your “dream team” situation. 3. Personal Vision (5 minutes) What is team communication like? How do team members relate to one another? How is VA data used? How are decisions, plans and changes made? 4. Review in Team (5 minutes) What stands out to you? Why did we choose these? What makes them so relevant or important to us? Can we address them all (bearing in mind our resources and time)? If not, which would we most like to address (align around), and why? 5. Putting it Together (10 minutes) Overall “Modeling to Learn” objectives include activities and competencies that: Are meaningful for you and align your learning goals with your team’s. Develop systems thinking skills - help you see how several things fit together and understand causes that are hard to see without data and modeling resources. Make VA data, initiatives and standards transparent to you. Empower you to realize ongoing improvements in team quality of care and team quality of work life. 6.

I’m ________________ (facilitator’s name) and I’m _______________ (co-facilitator’s name). Today we’re modeling to learn how to align our team vision. Throughout Modeling to Learn, we will start each session in our Learner See Guide at MTL.HOW, which is what we’re sharing on our screen now. We’ll review what was Done prior to the session and what we will Do in the session, as well as the specific MTL resources that we’ll be using. In the Session 1 Done and Do table, you can see that for today, we logged in to mtl.how/live for screen-sharing during the team meeting and called in to the VANTS line for audio. Your home base is mtl.how for ALL of the tools and resources we’ll use in Modeling to Learn, so if you ever forget a link or VANTS number or anything, just type mtl.how into your browser. Our DO for this session is to Launch Modeling to Learn and select a Team Vision for MTL. Done and Do (15 minutes) Done Do We join the Microsoft Teams meeting invitation from Outlook and called in, if needed. We will begin Modeling to Learn and select a Team Vision for MTL. Learning Objectives By the end of this session you will be able to: Describe your own vision for what you would like your team to get from Modeling to Learn. Test out your thinking with your team about what your shared vision is for becoming a “dream team.” Identify a shared team vision for learning from Modeling to Learn. Let’s get started! In-session Exercise (30 minutes): Team vision We learn best when we seek to accomplish things that matter to us. Today we will clarify what we are trying to accomplish together with Modeling to Learn. This learning process will be something you commit to because it reflects a key part your own vision for care in this team. Identifying a shared purpose can be deeply motivating. We want to identify a shared purpose about what we are trying to achieve as a team participating in Modeling to Learn. The team learning goal provides the focus and energy for committing to learning together over the coming weeks. We have limited time, so we want to identify what is most central to team learning goals and connect this to daily team care delivery. Team learning is all about ‘alignment’ and getting people working in sync with one another to meet the needs of our Veteran patients. We will explore “what is” (retrospective data) and vision forward to “what we would like it to be” (future-oriented). The goal is to move from “my vision” to “our vision” and to shift the paradigm towards how things could be done with shared decision-making. Together, the clinic team lead and facilitation team will explore “What can be done better?” in a way that reflects common team aspirations. 1. Prior Team Learning Prompt (5 minutes) First, we want to set ground rules for our learning sessions. Think of a good learning experience in your team. It can be in a meeting or an informal exchange with a colleague. It can be when you learned a clinic procedure, an idea for treatment with a difficult patient, or when a team member unlocked a mystery of CPRS for you. Try to think of a time when you had an “aha!” Something finally made sense, or you could finally do something you couldn’t before. Jot down on scratch paper what it was that made it a good learning experience. What were the characteristics of the experience? Compile a team list. Most likely the following are true: The learning was hands-on and experiential. The learning is connected to the real world. The learning experience was personally relevant, interesting, useful, or meaningful to the learner. The learner had choices, shared authority, control, and responsibility. The learner learned from and taught others. The learner had the support he or she needed. The learning was individualized. If there were standards for the work, the learner could meet them in his or her own way. It was fun or left the learner feeling good. The experience helped the learner understand him- or herself. The learner experienced success and accomplishment with challenging work. 2. Best Case Scenario (5 minutes) Now let’s envision our Best Case Scenario. It is important to create a team language for learning; for aligning team decisions when there are roadblocks to consensus. Start by picturing Veteran mental health care in this team as you experience it now. The interactions and communications within the team, in and out of team meetings. The key people you rely on outside the team. The information and data you use to coordinate care plans, and the feelings you associate with it. Now picture the team learning over the next 6 months in a best case scenario, where things are happening in the team the way that you would ideally like them to. This is your dream team situation. 3. Personal Vision (5 minutes) Think about your Personal Vision for your team: What is team communication like? How do team members relate to one another? How is VA data used? How are decisions, plans and changes made? 4. Review in Team (5 minutes) Reflecting as a team on those individual visions: What stands out to you? Why did we choose these? What makes them so relevant or important to us? Can we address them all (bearing in mind our resources and time)? If not, which would we most like to address (align around), and why? 5. Putting it Together (10 minutes) Putting it all together, overall Modeling to Learn objectives include activities and competencies that: Are meaningful for you and align your learning goals with your team. Develop systems thinking skills that help you to see how several things fit together and understand causes that are hard to see without data and modeling resources. Make VA data, initiatives and standards transparent to you. Empower you to realize ongoing improvements in team quality of care and team quality of work life. 6. Select the Team Vision To wrap up, let’s home in on our Team Vision You can further word-smith the Team Vision after the session if you want. We’ll hold this vision up as a reminder of our shared goals to orient our learning throughout the MTL program. That’s it for Modeling to Learn how to align our team vision! Next is our Done/Do review Done and Do (15 minutes) Done Do We selected a Team Vision to orient our learning throughout the MTL program. We will hold this vision up as a reminder of our shared goals to orient our learning throughout MTL. Select a team lead and email Team PSD to set up our standing team meeting time. Log into mtl.how/data to look at the splash page. DO Demo We will help the team decide on a Team Lead and standing meeting time over the next week or two. The role of the Team Lead is to: be the main point of contact between the team and Modeling to Learn co-facilitators; help with scheduling MTL-related team meetings; become familiar with MTL resources and help team members trouble-shoot - mainly mtl.how/live (Adobe Connect, used for screen-sharing during meetings), mtl.how/data (the data user interface), mtl.how/sim (the simulation user interface); and provide leadership during MTL sessions, encouraging team participation in discussions and serving as computer simulation lead under co-facilitators’ guidance. Ideal characteristics of the Team Lead include Having strong relationships with fellow team members; Being organized; Having basic computer knowledge (some Excel experience is good); Attention to detail; and Commitment to process improvement and the use of data to improve care. Some considerations for choosing a standing meeting time are Whether the team works at a central location or is geographically dispersed; Clinic schedules; and Clinicians’ availability. All team members will receive a post-session email the week after each session from the Modeling to Learn staff, with Done and Do reminders and links to the necessary resources; and another pre-session email the week of the upcoming session.

Together, the clinic team lead and facilitation team will explore “What’s can be done better?” in a way that reflects common team aspirations. Setting ground rules for learning sessions Write down characteristics of good learning experience Facilitate discussion on characteristics that were written down Best Case Scenario Picture Veteran mental health care in this team as you experience it now. Consider interactions and communications within the team, in and out of team meetings. Think of the information and data you use to coordinate care plans, and the feelings you associate with it. Next, picture the team learning over the next 6 months in a best case scenario where the team is functioning in an ideal way – this is your dream team situation. Personal Vision Personal vision for the team. Consider: team member relations, team planning and decision-making, use of VA data to inform team care. Review in Team Facilitate discussion of individual personal visions for the team. Identify any themes and those visions the team would most like to address. Putting It Together Putting it all together, overall Modeling to Learn objectives include activities and competencies that: Are meaningful for you and align your learning goals with your team. Develop systems thinking skills and help you to see how several things fit together and understand causes that are hard to see without data and modeling resources. Make VA data, initiatives and standards transparent to you. Empower you to realize ongoing improvements in team quality of care and team quality of work life. Select the Team Vision That’s it for Modeling to Learn how to align our team vision! Next is our Done/Do review. Done/Do (15 minutes) Done Do We selected a Team Vision to orient our learning throughout the MTL program. We will hold this vision up as a reminder of our shared goals to orient our learning throughout MTL. Select a team lead and email us at mtl.help@va.gov. Log into mtl.how/data to look at the facility file. 5.2.3 Session 02 Say Guide Hello! I’m ________________ (facilitator’s name) and I’m _______________ (co-facilitator’s name). Navigating to the Learner See Guide for Session 2 at mtl.how, we see that today we’re modeling to learn how to check our patient data and team trends. Done and Do Done Do We identified our Team Vision of _______________ ; selected our Team Lead _______________ ; and set a standing team meeting time at _______________ . We logged in to mtl.how/data to look at the facility data. We will confirm and review Team Data for MTL relevant to our Team Vision. Learning Objectives Describe the decisions your team made in producing your team data table. Test whether team historical trends shown in the “viz” tabs reflect your expectations. Apply your clinical expertise to identify new information about a team patient in the “data” tabs. Done by 00:10 In-Session Exercise 00:10-00:15 Participatory Learning from Simulation This graphic illustrates how Modeling to Learn can help us to get more of our Veterans to the right care in the right time to meet their needs using participatory learning from simulation. We use the data user interface (UI) to look back at team trends over the past two years. We review the last two years of data to see what is in our team now. Backward looking data review is limited for guiding effective change. Even when we see trends that we like, we may not know what is causing those trends. And, we may be afraid that the next change we might make will undo it. It is also really demotivating to see trends we don’t like, and not know what is causing the problem. We will use the sim UI to look at team trends 2 years into the future to answer what if questions about different decisions the team could make. What we’re doing today is that looking back using the data UI. Simulation helps us to place a better initial bet about what is likely to pay off for our local Veteran community in terms of getting patients timely access to our highest quality care. In-Session Exercise Let’s get started! 00:15-00:20 Who would like to “drive” today? (Recommend the Team Lead) 1. Open an internet browser window. Go to mtl.how/data. First select your VISN and then select your facility.** This will take you to the VA’s corporate data warehouse site, the Business Intelligence Service Line (or BISL), where you will log in with your VA email and PIV passcode. This site contains Protected Health Information (PHI), so as a provider you will be granted access according to the permissions that are set up on your PIV. We’ll be opening the Modeling to Learn data user interface (UI) in Excel from here today. We’ll show you how files you pull from here will be saved back to the secure site, so that you can protect patient PHI just as you do in all your work. On the landing page, select your VISN. On the next page, select your team’s facility. 2. Explore the facility data. To view facility data click on the […] next to the file “facility.xlsb” and click “Edit” to open in Excel. Team files are in team folders. If you do not see a team folder, click on \"Request New Team Folder in the horizontal header next the BISL logo. The facility data is designed to show trends relevant to your team vision of for the last two years. Let’s explore the information available in the facility data Excel spreadsheet: There are two types of View options at the bottom of the spreadsheet. __________________ (Team Lead’s name) Will you please click through them, so we can see what each displays? View Displays Count (in Viz tabs) Count tables that match the viz graphs Data Sortable report of de-identified individual patient data Viz Visualization of trends over time. There are four main data sets in the facility data: (During intersession prep, facilitator should fill-in the rankings of the highest priority data categories that should be emphasized. Follow the team’s lead “live” during the meeting, but be prepared.) Rank Data Displays ___ Diag Primary diagnosis only on visits in that setting level. (Note: In DataDiag, unique visits are shown, since each visit can only have one primary diagnosis. For more detail, open up the data UI.) ___ Enc Encounter or visits types, such as medication management, psychotherapy, intakes etc. ___ HF Health Factors data related to visits, including evidence-based psychotherapy templates, and other clinical reminders and screenings. ___ Meas Standardized symptom scales, such as the PHQ-9 for depression or PCL-5 for PTSD, and suicide and behavioral risk flags. To sum up, there are three ways to view each set of data: Counts per month (within the associated Viz tab): vizDiag, vizEnc, vizHF, and vizMeas; Visual charts of trends over time: vizDiag, vizEnc, vizHF, and vizMeas Drill down patient-level data: dataDiag, dataHF, and dataMeas. 00:20-00:25 All data is sortable and filterable so that the team can transparently see how the charting you do all day becomes VA data. Last meeting ________________________ (team members’ names) mentioned concerns with __________________________ (themes from session 1 team vision). Time Stamp Team Learning Priorities Script for Session 2 What filtering options are available? Themes from the team vision to be highlighted. Team Data to Prioritize with the Team. Keep an eye on time For each “viz” chart, you can filter on location and clinic name (upper left) to zoom in to the clinic or VISTA clinic/“grid”. (During intersession prep facilitator should fill-in the rankings of the highest priority viz that should be emphasized during the team meeting. Follow the team’s lead “live” during the meeting, but be prepared.). Rank viz Options ___ vizDiag See trends in what types of diagnoses the facility/team is spending their time on (data are based on the primary diagnosis of each encounter, not the problem list for each patient.)* ___ vizEnc See trends in what services the facility/team is spending their time providing.* ___ vizHF See trends in what specifics the facility/team’s patients are getting in their encounters (in vis, this is a very long list.) ___ vizMeas See trends in what standard measures the facility is using on their patients. Are they screening more for alcohol use disorder or depression or PTSD?* ___ dataDiag can be sorted by primary diagnosis type based on ICD-10 code to see more detail on what happens in any one diagnosis type* ___ dataHF can be sorted by health factor type to see more detail on what happens in any one health factor type.* ___ dataMeas can be sorted by measurement type to see more detail on what happens in any one measurement type.* If the data is not loading or showing incorrect facilities/clinics, here’s how to refresh. To refresh your facility file’s data, right click on any tab at the bottom of the Excel spreadsheet and select “Unhide…”. In the “Unhide sheet:” dropdown, select “Control” and click “OK”. In the “Control” tab, select your VA facility’s station number in the “Station:” dropdown and click “Refresh”. Do not worry if you see your Excel worksheet become unresponsive as the data is refreshing and will take about 1-2 minutes to complete. As a warning, Do NOT click on “Propagate” as this is used by our data team to update facility data across the nation. To create a fresh data UI file, go through Steps #3-5. We will show you the steps but you already have a fresh data UI file. 3. Scroll to your team folder at the bottom of the page. Open the data_ui folder and open your data_ui file in Excel. If you do not have a data_ui file or need a newly updated one, copy the file in the Master_DataUI folder. This has a master data_UI file that has already been pre-selected for your facility/station. Click on the 3 dots […] next to the data_ui file. Click on “Edit” to open in Excel, then click “Edit Workbook” at the top of the sheet. 4. Go to the ClinicSelection tab. Use columns C-H to select the clinics that make up your team. This data_ui file has already been specified for your facility/station. You can sort by Clinic Name, Division Name, Physical Location, Primary Stopcode, Secondary Stopcode, and Default Provider. Note that this will pull all clinics used in the last two years, including de-activated clinics (denoted by a “ZZ” prefix). You can also see the de-activated clinic’s inactivation date in column I. Follow the instructions in Box A2. After filtering, you can double-click on clinics to add them to column A, or you can highlight the clinics and click the gray “add all” button (Cell B6) to add them to column A. In the future, if you want to quickly get the same list of clinics again, you can select the grey “Get previous clinic list from last click of Get Patient-level Data” arrow in Column B (Cell B3). 5. To view your team patient data and your team trends click “Get Patient-level Data.” We will not do this in-session today. You already have a fresh data UI file to work with in your data_ui folder. With your team lead (________), we selected the following clinics to represent your team. To query patient and clinic level data using the data_ui, you will need LSV permissions. To check which facilities you have LSV access for, click the link to access the document through VA intranet. If you don’t have access to facilities that you believe you should, please verify: CPRS access/permissions at your station (i.e COR tab access for CPRS). Your network username recorded in VistA. To have your network username recording in VistA, please follow the instructions outlined in the linked document through VA intranet. It takes some time to stitch together a “hyper-local” query tailored to your team from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse. On average (depending on the size of your team) it may take 15 minutes or so for your team data UI to pull in fresh data. And, Microsoft Excel will be unresponsive until the data UI has finished pulling in your data. **Prior to today’s session, __________________ [Team Lead’s name] worked with us to build an initial team dataset. __________________ [Team Lead’s name], which column did we find most helpful for creating this team’s dataset? Are there any adjustments that the team would make to the clinic selection criteria? For example, should we include trainees? Other considerations that seem important? We will look at the “Create Team Data Table” button and its associated tab “SPReferrals” next time. 6. Click to view the “viz” tabs, which show team trends. Just like the facility data, there are team trends for diagnoses, encounters, health factor data (e.g., suicide plans, evidence-based practice templates), and measures from mental health assistant. Your team’s vision was about _______________. Let’s go to the _________________ viz tab to see data relevant to that issue. You can further drill up/down in the “viz” tabs by right clicking on any trend line and clicking on “Quick Explore\" (look for the magnifying glass). In the ”Explore“** box, pick the item you want to explore and click on \"Drill To”. Keep using Quick Explore to drill until you reach the data you want. You can always click on the gray “Reset Pivot Chart”** button to return to the original settings. The viz tabs will also always return to default selections every time the team clicks on “Get Patient-level Data” to refresh data in their data_ui file. Note: If you use the “Quick Explore” drill down using patient names, all of the asterisked patients will be grouped together. You can also right click on the line in a trend visualization and filter to hide a selected item or keep only the selected item. vizDiag in the data UI shows a drill down by diagnoses or combination of diagnoses. For example, the “PTSD” line is for patients with only PTSD. The “PTSD &amp; AUD” line is for patients with both these diagnoses but does not discriminate between which is the primary, secondary, etc. diagnoses. dataDiag in the data UI has an additional column after “Diagnoses of Interest,” called “Primary Diagnoses”. “Diagnoses of Interest” retains all the current unordered diagnoses combinations, while “Primary Diagnoses” indicates what is the primary diagnosis. This means that if there is only one diagnosis in the “Diagnoses of Interest” column, it will still repeat what that diagnosis is in the “Primary Diagnoses” column. 00:25-00:35 What stands out to you about ________________________________(fill-in team vision)? What is most important to you to check out first related to ________________________________(fill-in team vision)? (Prepare in advance, but ask this as an open-ended question)? What is most surprising? (Prepare in advance, but ask this as an open-ended question)? 00:35-00:40 7. Click to view the “data” tabs, which show your team’s individual patient information. - Patients who have requested restricted access to their information have asterisks (****) in Column F &amp; G. If you are a VA provider, you can still identify patients from Column H. - Patient information corresponds to the same categories as the team trends: diagnoses, encounters, health factor data (e.g., suicide plans, evidence-based practice templates), and measures from mental health assistant. - Providers can filter to find specific patients, or produce reports. 00:40-00:50 (During intersession prep facilitator should fill-in the rankings of the highest priority viz that should be emphasized during the team meeting. Follow the team’s lead “live” during the meeting, but be prepared.) Time Stamp Team Learning Priorities Script Prioritize which questions you will use given this team’s guiding vision. Keep an eye on time Themes from the team vision to be highlighted. Team Data related questions to Prioritize with the Team. What data tab would you use to find out how many current patients on the team are engaged in a specific evidence-based psychotherapy? What column shows you the session number (EBP template) that the patient is on. What viz tab would you use to see what the most common service encounters or visits are? Are there services that have been increasing over time? Are there services that have been decreasing over time? With the team trends (viz) and team patient (data) information in the data UI, your team can efficiently use team meetings to focus on the interrelated issues of care coordination and team quality improvement. That’s it for Modeling to Learn how to check our patient data and team trends. Next is our Done/Do review. Done and Do (15 minutes) Done Do We confirmed the clinics that make up our team for the Team Data UI. Review the HF, Diag, Enc and SP tabs in Team Data UI to find a patient (zoom in) and find a team trend (zoom out). Log in to mtl.how/data and look at the two team folders: data_ui and team_data_table. DO demo We encourage you to look around in your team data before next time. Go to mtl.how/data and open the team data in Excel. While waiting for the excel to open, let’s review the three reasons to use the excel-based Data UI instead of the facility data Excel spreadsheet. You can select a set of clinics (grids) that exactly represent your individual team. All the patient-level data are identified with patient names. You can create the team data table parameters used by the simulation user interface. Review your individual patient data and identify team trends.

I’m ________________ (facilitator’s name) and I’m _______________ (co-facilitator’s name). Today we’re modeling to learn how to produce team data for simulation. As you see in the Done and Do table of the Learner See Guide at mtl.how: Done and Do (15 minutes) Done Do We reviewed the HF, Diag, Enc and SP tabs in the Team Data UI to find a patient and a team trend. We logged in to mtl.how/data and looked at the two team folders: data_UI and team_data_table. We will produce our team_data_table for the MTL simulation user-interface (sim UI). After this session you will be able to: Learning Objectives Describe your team trends over the last two years based on the estimates in the team data table. Test your understanding of how the team data are estimated by reviewing descriptions and definitions. Apply your clinical expertise to consider the team trends in the data UI and team data table to identify team priorities for learning. Let’s get started! As the graphic illustrates, we use the data UI to look back at team trends over the past two years - what is; and we will use the sim UI to look at team trends 2 years into the future to answer what if questions about different decisions the team could make. In-session Exercise (30 minutes): Team data table for simulation Navigate to the data UI at mtl.how/data. You’ll log in with your VA credentials and you should have all the same permissions here as you do in general for your role in the VA. Scroll down to your team folder. You should have two folders: data_ui and team_data_table. Click on the “data_ui” folder and open the Excel file. Clicking the “Create Team Data Table” button produces a table of descriptive team data. You already have a fresh Team Data Table file to work with in the team_data_table folder. It takes some time to generate a team data table for all modules using your team’s data. On average (depending on the size of your team) it may take 15 minutes or so to generate a team data table. And, Microsoft Excel will be unresponsive until it is finished. This is a different table from the one you generated last time by selecting the clinics that make up your team and then clicking “Get Patient Level Data.” Data in this file are means, medians and percentages of key variables likely to influence the team’s priorities for learning from Modeling to Learn. Later on, we will upload this file to the sim UI so that it can read in these data, or parameters. There are team data produced for each module of Modeling to Learn, each stored in its own tab: Care Coordination (CC) - tab title CCParams Medication Management (MM) - tab title MMParams Psychotherapy (PSY) - tab title PSYParams Aggregate mix of services (AGG) - tab title AggParams Measurement Based Stepped Care and Suicide Prevention (SP) - tab title SPParams The patient cohort for each module is built by capturing all the unique patients who had a visit with the given team (from the user-supplied list of clinics/grids) within the correct encounter bin between 18 and 6 months ago. From that set of clinics, patients, and CPT codes, the data query then fetches all visits, no matter how long ago or how recent. In order to capture parameters that should be time-bound, such as new patients per week, the query can use that single year (e.g. from the patient cohort, how many were new to the team in the year that was used to build the cohort? Because that patient count captures all new patients over the year, we can just divide by 52 to get an average new patients per week). For parameters that should not be time-bound, all the visits can be considered, so that some patients will correctly be fed into the model with many visits over years of engagement. We have already produced a team data table for you, but to do it yourself: Select a set of clinics in ClinicSelection tab similar to what you did last session. In the future, you can pull up the same clinics used last time for creating the team data table by clicking on the gray “Get previous clinic list from Create Team Data Table file” button (Cell B4) to add them column A. Additionally, if you want to produce team data for the SP module, click on the SPReferrals tab. Use this tab to select clinics that your team refers to/receives referrals from for the Suicide Prevention module. The data pull will track patients stepped up/down between your team and the one(s) you select. For example, if you are a GMH team, you would select “SMH” in the dropdown for “The clinics selected below that my team refers to are” and add the SMH clinics your team refers to in Column A. Once you have selected referral clinics in the SPReferrals tab, return to the “ClinicSelection” tab. Click on the module drop-down. You can choose any module individually (CC, MM, PSY, AGG, SP), all modules without SP, or all modules including SP. If you are choosing “SP” or “all with SP”, make sure to do the previous steps using the SPReferrals tab. Click on “Create Team Data Table”. If you included SP in the module selection, three pop-ups will appear for the three possible care settings (GMH, SMH, PC/PCMHI) to indicate the threshold for minimum gap in patient care required for subsequent visit to be considered a new care episode. In general for the (GMH or SMH or PC/PCMHI) setting, how long of a gap in patient care is required for the subsequent visit to be considered a new care episode? Set the threshold below in weeks. The default threshold is 39 weeks (9 months). The team_data_table file you generate will automatically be saved into the team_data_table folder. Regardless of the module selection you make, the team_data_table file will include all five module tabs and labels, but will populate zeroes (“0”) for all parameters of modules that were not selected. Navigate back to your team folder at mtl.how/data. Click on the “team_data_table” folder and open the Excel file to find the team data table already produced for you. 1. Select a module for review To show what data are used to tailor each MTL module to your team. [Choose a module] CCParams: Key variables of interest in CC may include median engagement in weeks, appointment supply in appointments per week, return visit interval in weeks, starting rate in patients per week, and new patient wait times. MMParams: Key variables of interest in MM may include median engagement in weeks, appointment supply in appointments per week, return visit interval in weeks, starting rate in patients per week, and slots allocation percent for providers with and without an X waiver. PSYParams: Key variables that can be explored in PSY include median engagement duration and engagement after the patient’s first 3 months measured in weeks, appointment supply by service type (AUD, DEP, OUD, PTSD) within 3 months, and return visit interval after 3 months in weeks. AggParams: Key variables in AGG include median engagement in weeks, appointment supply by service type, return visit interval in weeks, new patient start rate (mean), and service proportions from team data. SPParams: In SP, key variables of interest may include high risk flag rates, engagement times before ending treatment in a specific setting, engagement time before stepping down or up between care settings, wait times, and the ratio of high to low symptom patients in each setting. Check out the different modules that are highlighted in the team data on the screen. As we review, we will use the mouse to highlight key team data variables. Find a variable that is important to your team. Look at how the variable is estimated in the table. Notice the units. Where can you find even more detailed information about your team data? In each of these Params tabs, you can find more detailed information about your team data. Check out the two columns to the right of the numerical data [show with mouse]. Let’s explore these two columns. This column [highlight column] gives the description or definition of the variable. This column [highlight column] contains additional details about how individual patient data are extracted and used to calculate your team’s historical trends. 2. Select a second module for review Check out the last 2 columns, to the right of the numerical data. This column [highlight column] gives the description or definition of the variable. This column [highlight column] contains additional details about how individual patient data are extracted and used to calculate your team’s historical trends. Find a variable that is important to your team. How is it estimated in this table? What are its units? Where can you find even more detailed information about your team data? You can click on the “DataNotes” tab for a breakdown of how the patient cohort is defined, which CPT codes are used to define each service, and the patient engagement patterns (for the Psychotherapy module). 3. Are there any team data table values you would like to explore in the team data UI? If so, which ones? Open the data UI to examine your question. 4. Does the team see any values in the team data that seem to vary significantly from expectations? If so, what is it surprising? Does the estimation definition (second to last column, text in red) help you to interpret the variable value? 5. Does the team see any values in the team data that fit your expectations about high priority team needs? If so, what are you noticing? In what ways does the team data fit with your day-to-day clinical practice in your team? That’s it for Modeling to Learn how to produce team data for simulation. Next is our Done/Do review. Done and Do (15 minutes) Done Do We produced team data table for the MTL simulation user-interface (sim UI). Find something in the team data table and complete the mtl.how/menu (behind VA firewall) to prioritize your needs. Responses are confidential. DO demo We encourage you to look around in the team data table before next time. Test whether you can find a piece of data you decide to look for. Just take a minute, if you can, to become familiar with the format and content of the data table. Remember, you can click through the Params tabs, one for each module, to dig into the details of how each parameter is calculated in the text columns to the right of the numerical data. The next thing we ask is that each member of the team fill out a short form that you’ll find at mtl.how/menu. It will take about 12 minutes. Your responses will be confidential; no identifying information is collected. We will aggregate the responses and consider them together in the next session to help the team choose which MTL module we’ll use for the next several sessions of Modeling to Learn. Until next time, thank you for Modeling to Learn! 5.2.6 Session 03 Say Checklist Today we’re modeling to learn how to produce team data for simulation. Hello!

Are there any team data table values you would like to explore in the team data UI? 6. Do you see any team data values that differ a lot from what you would expect? 7. Do you see any team data values that confirm your thoughts about high priority team needs? What are you noticing? What is surprising? In what ways does the team data fit with your day-to-day experience? That’s it for Modeling to learn how to produce team data for simulation. Next is our Done/Do review. Navigate to the SEE guide to show Done/Do table ____________ Time 00:50-01:00 – Done / Do Review Done: We produced team data for the MTL simulation user-interface (sim UI). Do: Find something in the team data table. Complete the mtl.how/menu to prioritize your needs. Responses are confidential. DO demo Encourage team members to look around in the team data table before next time. Ask team members to fill out form at mtl.how/menu (open on Chrome or Edge for the best experience). The username is yout VA email. It will take about 5 minutes. Responses will be aggregated and discussed in Session 4 to help choose which MTL module we’ll use for the next several sessions of Modeling to Learn. Until next time, thank you for Modeling to Learn! 5.2.7 Session 04 Say Guide MTL Live Session 04 Today we’re modeling to learn how to prioritize team needs. Hello! I’m ________________ (facilitator’s name) and I’m _______________ (co-facilitator’s name). Today we’re modeling to learn how to prioritize team needs. As we see in the Done/Do table of the Learner See Guide: Done and Do (15 minutes) Done Do We found something in the team data table and completed the mtl.how/menu to prioritize our needs. We will review the MTL Menu results to prioritize our team needs and select an MTL module. After this session you will be able to: Learning Objectives Describe the high priority needs reported across the team. Test out how these needs are experienced across the team through team dialogue. Consider the team vision and apply team decision-making to select a high-priority module of MTL. Let’s get started: In-session Exercise (30 minutes) Menu results and team needs discussion. 1. Complete the MTL Menu on your own. If you have not completed the MTL Menu at mtl.how/menu, please take 5 minutes to complete it. Your username is your VA email. Once everyone on the team has completed the MTL Menu, and we will show the tabulated results [Show Menu Results]. You will receive a summary of this in your follow-up email. 2. Review the team’s results with your team. What stands out to you? First we’ll scan through the results and see what stands out. [Lead discussion; take notes.] 3. Look for areas of consensus among the team. What does the team agree about? Where are there areas of high consensus? What issues does the team agree about? Decide which Menu results to show to reinforce consensus, based on relevance to the team’s priority needs and ability to assist us with our differential. Should be related to charts shown in Session 3. 4. Discuss items in which team members varied a lot in their rankings. Where does the team have more variable perspectives? What are the topics where team members’ perspectives are more divergent? Decide which Menu results to show to discuss divergence, based on relevance to the team’s priority needs and ability to assist us with our differential. Should be related to charts shown in Session 3. 5. Focus on the high priority needs to select a module for sessions 5-10 of Modeling to Learn. What is the highest priority need for your team now? Let’s think about which Modeling to Learn module best addresses that need. [Recap the highest priority need, recommended module, and why.] There are currently 5 MTL modules available for teams to focus on in sessions 5 through 10: Care Coordination (CC) Medication Management (MM) Psychotherapy (PSY) Aggregate mix of services (AGG) Measurement-based stepped care and suicide prevention (SP) What the models do: CC shows how a variety of team decisions interact to impact multiple outcomes at the same time. You can explore trade-offs between decisions such as desired new patient wait times, current patient return visit intervals, and overbooking, and how they affect team outcomes like total missed appointments, number of patients in care, and number of patients completing care. MM enables you to experiment with how team decisions about referrals, time allocation, and visit frequency impact the quality of medication management for patients. Your team can explore scenarios to balance these tradeoffs and better meet the specific needs of patients with depression, alcohol use disorder and opioid use disorder. Insights you gain can help you increase local reach of evidence-based pharmacotherapies. PSY shows how team psychotherapy decisions interact, and depicts patterns of psychotherapy engagement in your team. You can explore solutions to the challenges of getting patients to complete a full course of therapy, while also achieving goals to start enough new patients in psychotherapy. Insights about these dynamics can be used to increase the local reach of evidence-based psychotherapies. AGG shows how a variety of team decisions interact to affect your overall mix of services. You can explore trade-offs between decisions such as desired new patient wait times, current patient return visit intervals, and overbooking, and how they affect team outcomes like total missed appointments, number of patients in care, and number of patients completing care. You can compare the effects of different decisions on outcomes in one service, or you can compare the effects of one decision on different services. SP shows the effects of measurement based stepped care on patients’ symptoms and risk. It allows you to explore the impacts of implementing measurement based care to reduce delays in detecting patients at high risk for suicide, and to improve the quality of care by making better team decisions about when to step patients up to a higher level of care, or step them down to a lower level of care. It is also possible to experiment with team decisions related to new patient wait-times and access, the use of community care, and the impacts of provider overwork and burnout on the quality of care. That’s it for Modeling to learn how to prioritize team needs. Next is our Done/Do review. Done and Do (15 minutes) Done Do We prioritized team needs and selected an MTL Module: care coordination (CC), medication management (MM), psychotherapy (PSY), suicide prevention (SP) or aggregate (AGG). Log in to the MTL simulation user interface (sim UI) at mtl.how/sim. DO demo For the next 5 sessions, we will use the Modeling to Learn Simulation User Interface, or sim UI. Remember, all the MTL resources can be accessed from your home base at mtl.how if you forget a specific link. But to go directly to the log-in page for the sim UI, just type mtl.how/sim into your browser. The sim UI does not work on the Internet Explorer, please use any of the other available browsers such as Edge, Chrome, FireFox, or Safari via desktop or mobile. The sim UI is designed for use with a variety of devices, from large-monitor desktops to tablets and smartphones. The view adjusts for different sizes and aspect ratios so you may notice some slight variations in how it looks, but the basic functionality is the same on all of them. To log in to the sim UI, you will need your username and password. Once you enter your credentials, you’ll be asked to select a World, and you’ll see 2 options in the drop-down menu: a team world and an individual world. We’ll describe these more next time.

Orient yourself to the Main Page of the Sim UI (Notice the same information and buttons at top; 4 sections with blue header - one showing the module and team data selected in its header; the others headed Outputs and Text, Experiments, and Text). You see the same information and buttons across the top as the Home page. There’s a new set of sections with blue headers below that. Let’s click inside the large blue header on the left to minimize that section, because we aren’t going to need it today. But notice inside that bar it tells you which module and team data file we selected. To the right of the main section are 3 blue bars labeled Outputs and Text, Experiments, and Text. You can drag the Text section around by the blue bar. You can also expand, minimize, or close it with the icons on the top right side of the blue bar. Expand it to open up the Outputs section, including the Text boxes. Reduce it back to Text-only the same way you expanded it. If you close it with the X, you can get it back by going to the Outputs and Text section and selecting Expand. You can use the app’s responsive design feature to enlarge the view. Use the magnifier (+/-) or the shortcut Control/Shift/+ (or minus) to make things bigger or smaller. At some point, the design layout changes to stacked sections instead of having them side by side. This is the way it will look on a smartphone screen, or sometimes with other types of monitors. Record the team’s high-level learning Question. Open and expand the Outputs and Text section if you need to. Type your question about _________________________________ into the Question box. Click Save. We will discuss naming more next time. For now, just click the down arrow at the first prompt and choose “bc” (stands for base case), and Add, then click the Save button at the top. (We do not want to “save and reset”.) Click Yes at the prompt. Check out the Team Data Table. 8. Expand the Experiments section and read the “i” information for the Team Data Table. Open the section by clicking on the white down arrow in the right corner of the blue bar. The data in this table come straight from the file we just uploaded. In fact, throughout the sim UI, we’ve used the convention that red font means “read in from team data”. Click on the “i” in the red circle next to Team Data and read the “i” information. Throughout the Sim UI, we use “i” symbols for information pop-ups. Here, the “i” information is telling you how the data that you record, that you reviewed and chose in the data UI, are used to calculate or estimate the values in this Team Data Table. What types of decisions does the team make that affect these variables? Close the “i” information and look over the values - how do they strike you? Do they line up with how you think things are in your team? In particular, notice 9. Find the Team Data Table variables in the system diagram at the left. True Missed Appointments % Appointment Supply Return Visit Interval Engagement Duration New Patient Start Rate (AGG) 10. Log out of the Sim UI. That’s it for Modeling to Learn how to log in to our team world! Have Team Lead pull up the session 05 SEE guide Done/Do review. We logged in and uploaded our team data table to the sim UI, and reviewed our team data in the Experiments section. Check the “i” information available in the sim UI Model Diagram and Experiments section. DO demo For next time, if you can, log in to to the sim UI at mtl.how/sim. Remember that when you first enter your log-in credentials, you’ll be able to choose between your Team world and your Individual world. If you choose your Team world, it will already have a “session” started - because we did that today when we chose the module and selected the team data file that we had added. So you will choose Join Current Session and click Play. If you’re ambitious to dig in and “play” in the sim, you can choose your Individual world and add the team data to the team data menu the same way we did just now. Then you can choose the module, select the data, and click Play. You can explore to your heart’s content in your Individual world without worrying that you’ll “break” anything or change anything for the rest of your team. Whichever way you get to hitting Play from the Sim UI landing page, it will take you to the main page for the module. We encourage you to explore the interface more. In particular, check out the “i” information available throughout the sim UI - in the Experiments section and in the model diagram - to prepare for our next session. 5.2.11 Session 06 Say Guide MTL Live Session 06 Today we’re modeling to learn how to tell a systems story.

Team lead shares Chrome and logs in to the Team world at mtl.how/sim.**** _____________ Time 00:15-00:20 - Team’s Session 05 Question __________________ Let’s explore the MTL Home Page. To start this session, you should log in to your team world at mtl.how/sim, where you enter your username (email address) and password. After you click LOGIN, a pop-up box will appear with the text “Please select a World” on the blue bar. Select the world that ends with “team” from the drop-down menu. Once you’re on the MTL Home Page, look over on the left section with Session in the blue heading bar. Since we logged in to the Team World last time, you’ll see the name of the module and the dataset we chose under the first option, Join Current Session. Select that and hit Play. Now check what you’re seeing against what we’re showing on the screen. It should have your TEAM name at the top left, and YOUR name and photo at the top right, and YOUR team’s dataset listed in the blue bar of the main section above the model diagram, here. Also, depending on the size of your monitor and whether your browser window is full-screen or less, you might see more or less than what we’re showing of the model section. The model screen is a dynamic graphic, so the main model diagram will adjust if you re-size the browser window. On a PC, you can re-size your screen to get more or less of the diagram to show up at once by clicking the stacked boxes icon in the far top right of your computer screen. On a MAC, to view the model in full screen click the green button in the upper left of the browser on your computer. To exit full screen, hover at the top of your computer screen, the toolbar will appear, click on “View”, click on “Exit Full Screen.” Navigate to Text section to pull up the Question from last time. In-Session Exercise - Part 1 Introducing the Simulation User Interface Main Section with the Model Diagram in relation to team’s priority. _____________ Time 00:20-00:30 - Team Priority__________________ Now we’re ready to explore the simulation user interface main section with the model diagram in relation to your team. 1. Over what time frame does an experiment run? See the box titled Experiment Timeline in the top corner of the diagram section. This shows the time frame over which an experiment will run. What is the maximum time into the future you can simulate? Two years from today. 2. Where do you find the descriptions for each variable in the module? Paste a portion of a description from one of the Rates into the chat box. Notice the blue circle “i” in the diagram. These provide information on how model variables are calculated by the sim UI from the red variables that are read in from team data. The small circles with i inside throughout the sim UI provide additional information when you click on them. Red circle “i” in the team data table provides information for the red variables that are read in from team data. Circle “i” in the Experiments section provides information on what you’re changing when you adjust a variable to run an experiment. 3. Describe in one sentence what happens in the model diagram as you “Reveal Complexity?” Inside the Experiment Timeline box you also see a set of options to Reveal Complexity. You can select check-boxes to bring more of the model diagram into view, or uncheck the boxes to make it less visually complex. The amount of detail showing in the model diagram does NOT affect your experiments; the model always accounts for all the complexity regardless of how much is being viewed at the time. 4. What is the significance of the variables in the “red boxes”? In our convention, Red means read in from team data. In-Session Exercise - Part 2 Introducing stocks/flows and polarities among key variables related to the team’s priority. _____________ Time 00:30-00:40 - Team Priority__________________ Starting Point: Main model section with no additional complexities revealed. Tip: If you are not able to see the whole model diagram at once, try altering the size of the window using the browser’s expand/reduce button and dragging the frame. The display will adjust to a stacked format that will get more of the diagram into one view. Imagine a veteran in care. Tell the systems story told by the diagram in real-life terms. Make notes where you have questions or are unsure about the relationships depicted. Describe the connection between the model diagram and the team data table. How are they linked? What are the main units Modeling to Learn? Appointments/week Patients/week Episodes of Care (SP): Episodes of Care appears on the model diagram for Measurement Based Stepped Care and Suicide Prevention and in the Team Data Table. However, all of the Output charts are still in the units of appointments, appointments/week, patients, or patients/week. Let’s do a quick orientation to the model diagram. The navy blue circles or gauges are always a rate. The navy blue rectangles are patients or appointments. In telling a systems story, we want to trace the loop all the way around until we are back where we started - so that we close the feedback loop and fully understand why behaviors happen in our clinics. On the model diagram, you see plus and minus signs next to the blue lines. Use Thumbs to demonstrate +/- concept: If there is a plus sign between two variables, this means they move in the same direction (thumbs both up for increasing or both down for decreasing). If there is a minus sign, the two variables move in opposite directions (1 thumb up, 1 thumb down; and reverse). Cover complexity reveal (causal loop) and base case question and dynamic hypothesis related to the team’s priority. _____________ Time 00:40-00:50 - Team Priority__________________ Walk-throughs of each loop in each module are included in a table below. Enter a base case question and hypothesis in the Text section. In the Question box, add a base case question about no new decisions in addition to the team need question that the team wrote last session. In the Hypothesis box, briefly describe what you expect to happen over the next two years if the team continues with business as usual. Click on the Save (not Save &amp; Reset) button in the upper right corner of the Text section. This will allow us to quickly pull it up at the next session. The last thing to do is log out of the SIM UI! 00:50-00:55 That’s it for Modeling to Learn how to tell a systems story. Next is our Done/Do review. Today we told a systems story about our team’s top priority and entered a Question and Hypothesis in the Text section. Before next time, please log into your individual world and refine your Question and Hypothesis about the base case experimental run in the Text section. Done and Do (15 minutes) Have Team Lead pull up the session 06 SEE guide Done/Do review. _____________ Time 00:50-00:55 Done Do We told a systems story about our team’s top priority and entered a question and hypothesis in the Text section.

Table of System Stories MODULE – Loop – CARE COORDINATION – Wait Time Affects Referrals – We’ll reveal the “Wait Time Affects Referrals” detail in the Care Coordination or CC model diagram. Then, scroll down to the lower left of the model diagram to see what has been revealed. Remember, if you’re not sure how a variable is defined, check the i descriptions on the model diagram or in the Experiments section. The Wait Time Affects Referrals detail shows the connection between patient Referral Rates, patients Waiting to Start CC and Target Wait Times for patients. For this activity of telling a systems story, we are concerned patients are having to wait longer than we would like to start Care Coordination. So, we’ll start this systems story with the Referral Rate - the green box. As a clinician you know that when Referral Rates increase, there is an increase in the back log of patients Waiting to Start a service, in this case CC. As the patients Waiting to Start increases, the average New Patient Wait Time starts to climb. Note the plus sign from Waiting to Start to New Patient Wait Time which indicates they will move in the same direction. So, if the patients Waiting to Start decreases, the New Patient Wait Time will decrease also. Let’s continue with the assumption that New Patient Wait Time is increasing. As this wait time increases, it increases the Effect of Wait Time on Referrals which decreases the Referral Rate so referrals to CC begin to slow down. Patients may be kept in or referred to other services so that they don’t have to wait longer than the desired or target wait time for their first CC appointment. In addition to running experiments around our Target Wait Time, this loop shows that we can also experiment with team decisions about Referral Rate. We can ask questions like, “If the Referral Rate to CC goes up by some percentage because we’ve started graduating patients more quickly from other services - but our Starting Rate in CC stays the same because we don’t have any extra appointment slots for new patients - what will become the ‘new normal’ for New Patient Wait Times in CC?” MEDICATION MANAGEMENT – Wait Time Affects Referrals – We’ll reveal the “Wait Time Affects Referrals” detail in the Medication Management or MM model diagram. Then, scroll down to the lower left of the model diagram to see what has been revealed. Remember, if you’re not sure how a variable is defined, check the i descriptions on the model diagram or in the Experiments section. The Wait Time Affects Referrals detail shows the connection between patient Referral Rates, patients Waiting to Start MM and Target Wait Times for patients. We hear a lot of clinicians say that good, ethical treatment is if you start a patient on medication assistance, the patient should come in for a monthly evaluation. If a clinician isn’t sure they can get a patient in for a monthly appointment, then they may decide not to start the patient on the service. For this activity of telling a systems story in the Med Management module, we would like to explore how our team can serve more patients with specific conditions, like Opioid Use Disorder (OUD), with our existing staffing levels. We’ll start this systems story with the Referral Rate - the green box. As a clinician you know that when Referral Rates increase, there is an increase in the back log of patients Waiting to Start a service, in this case MM. As the patients Waiting to Start increases, the average New Patient Wait Time starts to climb. Note the plus sign from Waiting to Start to New Patient Wait Time which indicates they will move in the same direction. So, if the patients Waiting to Start decreases, the New Patient Wait Time will decrease also. Let’s continue with the assumption that New Patient Wait Time is increasing. As this wait time increases, it increases the Effect of Wait Time on Referrals. The Effect of Wait Time on Referrals is the difference between the New Patient Actual Wait Time and the team’s desired or Target Wait Time. In the Med Management module, we can adjust target wait times for different diagnostic patients. The “stacked” red boxes labeled Target Wait Time indicates you can change the target wait time by adjusting the red sliders read in from your team data for patients with Alcohol Use Disorder, Opioid Use Disorder, Depression and Other conditions. The effect of an increasing wait time on referrals, which has a negative sign, means a decrease to the Referral Rate so referrals to MM begin to slow down. Patients may be kept in or referred to other services so that they don’t have to wait longer than the desired or target wait time for their first MM appointment. PSYCHOTHERAPY – Balancing Existing and New Patients; Engagement After 3 Months – The Psychotherapy or PSY module shows how team psychotherapy decisions interact, and depicts patterns of psychotherapy engagement in your team. You can explore solutions to the challenges of getting patients to complete a full course of therapy, while also achieving goals to start enough new patients in psychotherapy. Insights about these dynamics can be used to increase the local reach of evidence-based psychotherapies. We’ll reveal the “Balancing Patients” detail in the PSY model diagram. Remember, if you’re not sure how a variable is defined, check the i descriptions on the model diagram or in the Experiments section. For this activity of telling a systems story, we want patients to complete a full course of PSY without decreasing the new patients that can start psychotherapy. So, if you as a clinician are totally full in your PSY slots, the only way you can start new patients is if patients quit or patients complete. Let’s scroll down the model diagram to see what has been revealed in the blue shaded box titled Patients in Their First 3 Months of Psychotherapy. The Reveal Complexity detail for Balancing Patients shows the flow of patients and appointments in the PSY model. We see patients start psychotherapy and a certain number of patients get their first visit of PSY and end there; you can see this in the model here [use mouse to show “Patients in First Visit”]. We know that other patients will go on for additional visits. In the model diagram, we can explore data for patients who attend 2 to 7 visits [use mouse to show “Patients in Visit 2 to 7”] but they haven’t yet completed a full course of PSY. Next, there is a subset of patients will go on to achieve 7 or more visits in their own first 3 months. Some will graduate and some will continue treatment after 3 months. Obviously our team wants patients to complete a full course of PSY without decreasing the new patients that can start. So, starting on the left side of the screen in the blue box. We can see that as the Starting Rate for PSY increases, it increases the Booking Rate. Remember, we follow the blue line upward to Booking Rate and there is a plus + sign which means the Starting Rate and Booking Rate move in the same direction. As the Booking Rate increases, this increases the appointments on the books for PSY [use mouse to show booking rate to appointments in PSY]. As the overall appointment supply goes up it can increase the overall appointments for new patients or existing patients. So, as the Appointments in Psychotherapy increases, we follow the light blue arrow to Appointments for Existing Patients and see that plus + sign indicating an increase in appointments on the books for existing patients. As the appointments for existing patients goes up, it decreases the appointments for new patients, as this goes down it decreases the Starting rate as shown with the long blue arrow down the left side of the screen that connects Additional Appointments Available to New Patients to Starting Rate with a plus + sign. AGGREGATE – Appointment Backlog Extends Return Visit Interval (under RVI and Wait Times) – Because the Aggregate or AGG model includes a mix of services, the Experiment Timeline box has two options: Reveal Complexity and Display Patient Services. If you click through the services listed under Display Patient Services you will see the numbers change in the dark blue circles and rectangles in the model diagram. This represents the our team’s appointments and patients data for each service. Remember, if you’re not sure how a variable is defined, check the i descriptions on the model diagram or in the Experiments section. Let’s show the “RVI and Wait Times” under Reveal Complexity in the AGG model. Our team is going to be losing two staff members in the near future. Since the aggregate module shows the interactions between all services offered by our team, we want to use this module to explore how we can best allocate appointments across services with reduced staffing levels. We also want to know what will happen to patient wait times if we change patient return-to-clinic visit intervals (RVI) and/or if the remaining staff members decide to work overtime or not. Let’s walk through a systems story focused on the balancing loop titled \"Appointment Backlog Extends Return Visit Interval right here on the model diagram [mouse over balancing loop on screen]. Let’s start In the Appointments section of the diagram with the Booking Rate. As the Booking Rate goes up, the Appointments increase. If there are more patients who need an appointment then there are appointments or clinical hours available, clinicians may feel work pressure. This is the light blue arrow with the plus + sign leading from Appointments to Work Pressure. When a clinic team experiences increasing Work Pressure then there is an Effect of Work Pressure on Scheduled Return Visit INterval such that as work pressure increases, there is an increases the time between appointments or the Return to Clinic Visit Interval. As the Return to Visit Interval increases the Booking Rate decreases, you can tell this by the negative sign at the end of the light blue arrow leading from RVI to Booking Rate. Thus, the balancing loop is Appointment Backlog Extends Return Visit Interval is complete. MEASUREMENT-BASED STEPPED CARE AND SUICIDE PREVENTION – Higher Care Quality Improves Recovery – Starting with Patient Load, which is [CLICK ON I TEXT AND READ], one way that increasing patient load influences the team is the effect on care quality. If the team has fewer patients than they can effectively treat, then the effect on quality decreases, and the care quality delivered to patients increases. When Care Quality increases, the number of patients in the grey box labeled Effect of MBC on Patient Symptoms and Risk decreases, which then decreases Patient Load, further increasing Care Quality. Let’s zoom in to this part of the diagram to see how that works by clicking on the plus sign in the upper right corner of the grey box [CLICK ON MEASUREMENT BASED CARE VIEW]. Here we see some of our same variables, including Care Quality, which has the same causal relationships in this view as in the previous view. When Care Quality goes up, two things happen: First, high-symptom patients improve faster than before (see the arrow to “Time to Improve” which affects the number of patients each week whose symptoms improve enough to be eligible to be stepped down to a less intense level of care), and Second, patients with high risk flags improve faster than before (see the arrow to “Time to UnFlag” which affects the rate at which patients with high risk flags have those flags removed). This causes more patients to flow into the “low symptom” group, so more patients can both end their care and be recommended to step down to a lower level of care. Now, click any one of the plus signs in a grey box to zoom out to the previous view [TOGGLE BACK TO STEPPED CARE VIEW]. As more patients leave this setting, it further reduces the total number of patients in the GMH treatment setting, thus further decreasing the patient load and increasing quality. When moving this direction, this type of reinforcing loop is often called a “virtuous circle.” However, this feedback loop also works in the opposite direction, where small increases in patients can lead to lower quality, more patients staying with “high symptoms,” resulting in even higher patient load. When this happens, this same loop is referred to as a “vicious circle,” or a “death spiral.” We have closed the loop, or brought our chain of causation full circle, and can now explain how this reinforcing loop of “Higher Care Quality Improves Recovery” could both energize our improvement efforts, or potentially derail them. – Higher Care Quality Improves Recovery Loop – In the Stepped Care View, start with Patient Load, which is the ratio of the total number of patients seen over the manageable total patients (i.e., demand over supply). One way that increasing patient load influences the team is the effect on care quality. If the team has fewer patients than they can effectively treat, then the effect on quality decreases, and the care quality delivered to patients increases. In the clinic, there could be many possible reasons for this effect: providers have more time to document and prep for each visit, more time to discuss cases as a team, more time for reminder calls, so more patients actually show up for their appointments, etc. When Care Quality increases, the number of patients in the grey box labeled Effect of MBC on Patient Symptoms and Risk decreases, which then decreases Patient Load, further increasing Care Quality. To see why this happens, zoom in to the part of the model that covers what happens inside the team (in the Measurement Based Care View). Here we see some of our same variables, including Care Quality, which has the same causal relationships in this view as in the previous view. When Care Quality goes up, two things happen: First, high-symptom patients improve faster than before (see the arrow to “Time to Improve” which affects the number of patients each week whose symptoms improve enough to be eligible to be stepped down to a less intense level of care), and Second, patients with high risk flags improve faster than before (see the arrow to “Time to UnFlag” which affects the rate at which patients with high risk flags have those flags removed). This causes more patients to become part of the “low symptom” group, so more patients can now both end their care and be recommended to step down to a lower level of care. Back in the Stepped Care View, as more patients leave this setting, patient load drops even farther, and quality increases even more. When moving this direction, this type of reinforcing loop is often called a “virtuous circle.” However, this feedback loop also works in the opposite direction, where small increases in the number of patients in care can lead to lower quality, more patients staying with “high symptoms” longer, resulting in even higher patient load. When this happens, this same loop is referred to as a “vicious circle,” or a “death spiral.” We have closed the loop, or brought our chain of causation full circle, and can now explain how this reinforcing loop of “Higher Care Quality Improves Recovery” could both energize our improvement efforts, or potentially derail them. – Work Pressure Delays Care Decisions Loop – In the Stepped Care View, start with Patient Load, which is the ratio of the total number of patients seen over the manageable total patients (i.e., demand over supply). One way that increasing patient load influences the team is the effect the team’s ability to assess and develop effective treatment plans for each patients. If the team has fewer patients than before, then they have more time to focus on patients early in care, who still need to establish whether or not a patient is high symptom and start them on an effective treatment plan. In the Measurement Base Care View, this effect directly impacts the variable “Time to Detect,” where an increase in the Patient Load causes the Time to Detect to increase, and vice versa. There is no limit to the positive effect decreasing workload has on providers’ ability to assess patients and develop effective treatment plans. This causes more patients to move through their care journey faster than before, so, all else being equal, more patients end treatment or step down to a lower level of care than before. Back in the Stepped Care View, as more patients leave this setting, patient load drops even farther, and Time to Detect falls even more. When moving this direction, this type of reinforcing loop is often called a “virtuous circle.” However, this feedback loop also works in the opposite direction, where small increases in the number of patients in care can lead to higher Time to Detect, more patients staying in the “Early in Care” status longer, resulting in even higher patient load. When this happens, this same loop is referred to as a “vicious circle,” or a “death spiral. We have closed the loop, or brought our chain of causation full circle, and can now explain how this reinforcing loop of”Work Pressure Delays Care Decisions \" could both energize our improvement efforts, or potentially derail them. – Work Pressure Reduces Access Loop – In the Stepped Care View, start with Patient Load, which is the ratio of the total number of patients seen over the manageable total patients (i.e., demand over supply). One way that decreasing patient load influences the team is the effect the team’s ability to start new patients. If the team has fewer established patients than before, then they have more open slots on their schedule for new patients. This effect directly impacts the “Total New Episode of Care Start Rate” (“Total” referring to the fact that this rate is all new episodes of care, regardless of where a patient is coming from). This effect seeks to represent the physical reality of having a schedule based on a fixed team capacity, where the team can only offer so many hours per week. There is no limit to the detrimental effect increasing workload has on start rate – a high-enough Patient Load could cut new care episode starts to zero. Any initial increase in the episode of care start rate is quickly undone, as these new patients become established patients, and their recurring appointments fill up the more and more of the open slots on the schedule. The limiting factor of team capacity prevent this initial change from being sustained. This is also true of a decrease in the start rate, as a team that starts fewer new patients but has the same number of patients leaving (either ending or stepping up/down) will soon have more open slots than they had before, allowing the start rate to increase. A feedback loop that counter-acts change is called a “balancing loop,” as any initial change will be washed out in the long run. This type of loop is helpful in maintaining performance, but if ignored, can often lead to unstained improvement efforts. – Access Pressure Increases Patient Starts – In the Stepped Care View, start with “Patients Waiting to Start Care,” which is the total number of patients who have been referred to this team, regardless of where they are coming from. If there are more patients waiting than before, then the wait time to start with this team increases above the acceptable value (the “Desired Wait Time,” which is estimated from the team’s data), and the team feels more pressure to start these patients to bring wait times back down. The team will then start more new episodes of care than before to alleviate the high wait time, even if they don’t have the capacity to effectively treat these patients. This effect is limited to 2x, as even the highest increase in wait times could only double the original episode of care start rate. As the team starts more episodes of care, the number of patients waiting drops, and the wait time falls back to the desired wait time. This is also true if the team experiences a decrease in wait times, as the team would then start fewer new episodes of care than before, until the wait time rose back to the desired value. A feedback loop that counter-acts change is called a “balancing loop,” as any initial change will be washed out in the long run. This type of loop is helpful in maintaining performance, but if ignored, can often lead to unstained improvement efforts. – Overwork and Burnout Reduce Care Quality – In the Stepped Care View, start with Patient Load, which is the ratio of the total number of patients seen over the manageable total patients (i.e., demand over supply). One way that increasing Patient Load influences the team is by increasing the team’s fatigue. If the team experiences a sustained increase in fatigue, eventually the total patients the team can manage effectively decreases (as providers have less time for each patient, make more mistakes, and take more sick days). If sustained for long enough, high fatigue will cause burnout and providers leaving the team, which drastically reduces the number of patients the team can manage. Unless something else changes in the team, as fatigue and burnout continue to build up, Patient Load will grow even more (the denominator is reduced, thus the ratio increases), forcing remaining providers to work even hard than before, and Manageable Total Patients falls even more. When moving this direction, this type of reinforcing loop is often called a “vicious circle,” or a “death spiral.” Unfortunately, this systems story doesn’t work the other way, as below-average workload cannot increase supply – we assume that no individual provider will book more appointments just because their team has fewer patients across their panels (shrinking numerator) or the team gets a new provider (growing denominator). 5.2.12 Session 06 Say Checklist Today we’re modeling to learn how to tell a systems story.

I’m ________________ (facilitator’s name) and I’m _______________ (co-facilitator’s name). Today we’re modeling to learn how to evaluate our Base Case of no new decisions. Start with a review of what was learned in the last session and what we will do during the session today: Time Stamp Prioritize tailored team learning Script 00:00-00:10 Review progress to date and learning objectives for this session Practice describing specific learning/skills developed last session and confirm consensus on team’s highest priority need. Done Do We logged in to our individual world at mtl.how/sim. We used the question we entered during the previous session and added our own hypothesis about the Base Case (bc) run in the Text section. We will run a “BC” simulation and review the impact of making no new decisions on ___________ [the variables relevant to the team’s question] in the MTL sim UI Outputs section. After this session you’ll be able to: Learning Objectives Describe the base case of no new decisions in your team. Test out your thinking about what is likely to cause oscillation in team trends. Apply systems thinking to develop a hypothesis about your team’s clinical priority. After this review, pass control over to the team. Ask the Team Lead to log into the SimUI, join the current session, and share their screen. Time Stamp Prioritize tailored team learning Script 00:10-00:20 Cue up the team’s question from Session 5 and hypothesis from Session 6 Review the team data that supports the team’s question and the systems story that supports the team’s hypothesis. Practice highlighting specific values from the Team Data table and variables from the complexity reveal (causal loop) that are guiding the in-session work to address the team’s highest priority need. In-session Exercise (30 minutes) Running a Base Case 1. Log in to your team world at mtl.how/sim. During the time it takes the team lead to start screen share and navigate to the sim, present the purpose of the exercise: The purpose for this activity is to test the hypothesis you developed in the last session. By the end, the team should be able to run an experiment in the SimUI, explore results, and be able to explain the systems causes that generated those results. 2. Join Current Session to pick up where the team left off. 3. Orient yourself to the main page: Team Name (when you’re in your individual world, the team name is your name); selected module (CC, MM, PSY, AGG, or SP); selected data file. All slider settings in the Experiments section are at Base Case or default values. “In the last session, you all created a question about your team’s top improvement priority and the Systems Story that surrounds that issue. Today we’re going to make that story come alive – we are going to run a simulation, and see the impact of these system causes over the next two years, as as function of our local capacities and constrains, as estimated with our local data. The first step in learning from simulation is to run a base case or “status quo” simulation against which all future experiments will be compared. Last time, you hypothesized that _____________ (include specific variables, loops, data).\" Now, in the window floating on the right side of the screen, add to the team’s question about the Base Case in the Our Question text box. Here you’ll briefly describe what your team wants to learn from this experiment of no new decisions. Example Question to add: What happens to ______________ (from the team’s priority) if we make no new decisions? There is important research showing that is not likely to improve learning to click around and run experiments without stating what you expect will happen over the next two years before you run the simulation. In order to benefit from experiential simulation learning, you need to create a hypothesis – an if/then statement about what you believe will happen over the next two years as a consequence of your change. Through this process you can be surprised, have some things confirmed, but perhaps also find that when more variables and complexity are accounted for, there may be counter-intuitive findings too. 4. Expand the Outputs and Text section and enter text in the boxes to reflect your question and hypothesis about a base case run – one where no new decisions are made in your team, and run the simulation out to its 2-year end just using data pulled in from your team data file. Add your hypothesis about the base case run results in the Our Hypothesis text box. Reference team data value relevant to the team’s question. We want to be as specific as possible, and we have the question, hypothesis, findings and decisions boxes here, which the teams can use as a lab notebook to track their thinking. They can then save their work, so that they can efficiently pick up where they left off, which is critical when time for team huddles in the clinic is very tight. Example Hypotheses to add: Outline the systems story your team believes will cause the outcomes your team expects to observe. – Module specific Hypotheses, Findings, and Decisions are included in a table below – Time Stamp Prioritize tailored team learning Script 00:20-00:25 Run a simulation and save results Ask the team lead to narrate this process. Helpful tip: To run the Base Case, let’s first make sure that all the Experiment sliders are indeed set for the Base Case. When you look in the Experiments section, you should see that the box next to each slider says either zero or bc. If it says bc, it means the value the model will run is the number from the Team Data Table. A few sliders have a different setting. If you see a purple Sensitivity slider, it will start at a default value of 1, which is the mid-range, between no relationship between those two variables, and a very strong relationship. (And if there’s a Team Data vs Balanced switch, Balanced will be the default setting.) 5. Run, then Save (without resetting) the run with the name Base Case. Once we’ve verified that sliders are set for the Base Case and we’ve entered our question and hypothesis, we’re ready to hit Run. (drum roll!) Now let’s open the Outputs section and see what we find. The quick way to do this is to click the “expand” button in the blue bar of the Texts section. This opens the full Outputs and Text section, which now shows all the Text boxes and a larger Results Dashboard where you can see several charts at once, and a Control Panel on the left. Before we go further, it’s a good time to go ahead and Save this run. Saving without Resetting will capture the text that we’ve written in the boxes and the settings and results of our run. We’ll still be able to enter more text to finish our consideration of this test as long as we don’t re-set the sim. So, click on Save at the top and then click Yes. This warning is just a reminder of how important it is to record your thinking in the Text boxes so your learning from what you’ve done doesn’t evaporate. The Save menu helps you enter a name for each run based on what sliders you moved. In this case, it’s the Base Case, so on the Variable drop-down menu just select Base Case and click Add. You’ll see “bc” entered in the Experiment Name field and now you can click Save again in the top right. Caution: Only choose the Save and Reset button at the bottom when you’re finished recording all you need to in the Text section. Or you can choose Discard if you weren’t ready to save or name the run. Time Stamp Prioritize tailored team learning Script 00:25-00:40 Describe findings/decisions and saving Practice describing specific output charts (system behaviors) you’re going to check and discuss as a team in relation to their team’s highest priority need. 6. Review the Current Experiment Values in the Control Panel: You should see all variables at base case or default values. This is where you can remind yourself of the settings for the current experiment or check to make sure they are what you meant to set. 7. Orient yourself to the charts in the Results Dashboard (axes, units, legend, drop-down menu options). Now let’s look at the Results. Notice that each chart has a title below it and a drop-down menu. You have a wide selection of variables to choose from to look at results. The units are shown inside the chart at the top left – usually Weeks, Patients, Appointments, or a Percent, or a rate like Patients per Week. The axes adjust dynamically – so even if the units of two side-by-side charts are the same, you have to check the scale before comparing them visually. 8. Describe what you see in the Our Findings textbox. What do you notice about the results for ________ [relevant to the team’s question]? Do they match your hypothesis? Compare the values in the charts with the Team Data Table numbers. 9. Record your Findings - what you learned from the Results compared to your Hypothesis. Add to the Our Findings text box your explanation for why the results do or do not conform to your hypothesis. Example Findings: Describe your team’s findings, insights and conclusions from this experiment. Time Stamp Prioritize tailored team learning Script 00:40-00:50 Come to consensus on the next experiment Practice guiding the team to the highest leverage experiments (changes that will impact the most patients) that represent actions they could take today. 10. In Our Decisions, record what these findings suggest doing differently in your team. Also write down what the team decided to investigate next. Now that we have an experiment to compare against, what changes do you want to test next? What is the first improvement idea you want to try as a team? Record this next step in the Our Decisions textbox. Example Decisions: Based on what you learned in this experiment, what changes are you ready to make in your practice? 11.

Until next time, thank you for Modeling to Learn! Base Case Dynamics for each module Module Example Text CC &amp; MM Hypothesis: If we make no new decisions then patients will start accumulating in “the waiting room” for care coordination. But then it will swing back the other way, and at some point the wait time will become steady at about the level it is now. This is because of the balancing that happens between using appointments for new and existing patients. The number of patients in care will stay constant. If we make no new decisions then we will reach the same proportion of our patients with medication assisted therapy for OUD. Findings: All variables will show no change over the next two years. Without any new decisions, the team will continue to experience their historically “normal” behavior. These flat lines could be seen as favorable, or not, depending on the team’s expectations. Example: “We can see our Return-to-clinic Visit Interval (RVI) in the base case is the same for all patient needs, but we’d like to better meet more specific needs of patients evidence-based pharmacotherapy (EBPharm).” Note: If team has prioritized data on “Existing Patient Return-to-Clinic Visit Interval,” then the RVI used by the team will match the estimate calculated from their patients’ data, but start rate generated by the model will not. If the start rate is higher than the estimate, then this implies that the team is actually working more efficiently (fewer missed appointments, shorter engagement durations, etc.) than we can see from the data or perhaps the 75th percentile we’re using to estimate their appointment supply is too conservative. If the start rate is lower than the data suggest, then the team could be facing more hurdles than we can see in the data, are seeing patients for longer, or perhaps the 75th percentile we’re using to estimate their appointment supply is too optimistic. Note: If team has prioritized data on “New Patient Start Rate,” then the start rate shown in the base case will match the estimate calculated from their patients’ data, but the RVI used by the team will not. If the RVI used by the team in the simulation is more frequent than the estimate, then this implies that the virtual team is either more efficient, has more capacity, fewer no-shows, or shorter engagement durations (or some combination) than the real-world team. If the RVI used by the virtual team is slower than the real team, then the opposite is true – that the real-world team is more efficient, has more capacity, fewer no-shows, or shorter engagement durations (or some combination) than we can see from their data. Decisions: Next time we will experiment with increasing our appointment supply by 5 appt/wk to attempt to reduce New Patient Wait Times. Next time we will experiment with increasing both our referrals to DEP and increasing those patients’ RVI to attempt to reduce our DEP wait times. PSY Hypothesis: If we make no new decisions then we expect that we will continue to see fewer Psy and EBPsy patients than we want because we aren’t graduating our psychotherapy patients. We hypothesis that the number of patients receiving an evidence-based dose of PSY is currently low, taking into consideration that Completers who Graduate is about 4% and that Initiators who Complete is just 37%. Findings: All variables will show no change over the next two years. Without any new decisions, the team will continue to experience their historically “normal” behavior. These flat lines could be seen as favorable, or not, depending on the team’s expectations. Example: Our team will continue to start ~3ppw, with the majority of our slots going to patients who have been in care after their first 3 months. Our completion rate will remain high (at 0.5 ppw), but our graduation rate will not improve, remaining at 0.04 implementation ppw (or one patient every 6 months). If the team is interested in how their supply is being used (the number of slots used by patients in their first 3 months, vs after), then the Sankey chart can reveal details on how many slots are currently used in each care pathways. Example: Based on the Sankey diagram, we understand that out of N=371 patients who have one PSY visit, n=289 are Initiators. Of these, only n=107 are Completers, and of Completers, on n=4 graduate after having an evidence-based dose of PSY (about 8 sessions in their first three months with the team). Patients who remain in care after their first three months take up the majority of slots, with patients who only get one visit in their first 3 months eventually taking 6 more visits before ending (thus never receiving a complete dose), and patients who complete but return taking 26 visits before ending (double the evidence base). Decisions: We can do much better. We can start by trying to increase the percentage of Completers who graduate, from 3.77% to as high as 75%. This will reduce the number of appointment slots used by patients who continue therapy after already receiving a complete dose, hopefully opening up more slots to new patients. AGG Hypothesis: If we make no new decisions, then, based on our team data, we expect to see that the majority of our patients will continue to receive MM. By far our MM and PSY patients have the longest engagement time and account for more than 40% of our services. Patients will continue to accumulate while waiting for care. Findings: Using the compare services features, our hypothesis is supported. Our baseline shows that we have more than 1000 MM patients in service, followed by PSY (about 300 patients), CC (about 260 patients), and by Adjunct (about 175 patients). Interestingly, patients receiving group services drops to about 100 patients at about 1.5 years into the experiment. Include dynamics = oscillations in xxxx caused by feedback loop…Drop in yyyy caused by Decisions: Ideally, we would like to reduce the median engagement time for both MM and PSY, as patients are receiving treatment time that is longer than recommended for PSY and the return visit interval time for PSY is also long (17 weeks between visits on average!). Reducing the engagement time should free up supply, while decreasing the RVI (i.e., meeting more frequently) should increase the slots used by our PSY patients. We hope to explore the trade-off between these two clinical decisions on our whole panel, and the ability to start new patients in PSY). SP Hypothesis: If we make no new decisions, then we expect to see no changes in care quality, performance, or wait times in all three settings – all the current historical averages for patients in care, step down rates, etc. will hold for the next two years. Patient risk will not improve. Findings: Since the teams in the simulation experience no external shocks and make no new decisions, the historical rates all continue for the next two years. We will still have about 4 patients with a high risk flag, and, if we click on the plus sign in the upper right corner of the “GMH to SMH Recommend Step up Rate” box and zoom out to see how our team is working with the rest of the Mental Health continuum, we see that we will continue to have about 57 high-symptom patients who are waiting to step up to Specialty Mental Health. If we look over to the Team Data Table, we can see that these patients are waiting an average of 28 weeks before starting treatment there. Now, if we minimize the table [CLICK ON THE RED ARROW] and open up “GMH Patients and Patients Waiting to Start,” we can see how many patients total are in care. Click on the “BC” button in “Manageable Total Patients” to see that we have 517 patients in care. Care quality does not improve (specifically, the team’s main concern of wait time to step up). However, if our manageable patient load stays the same over the next two years at the past two years, we shouldn’t expect things to get worse, either. Decisions: Given the high wait times to step to other settings and how hard it will be to reduce these wait times directly by working with leadership and the other teams, we should explore the effects of something that would be easier to implement - shift to using measurement-based care for all patients in our team - to see what both the positive and unexpected impacts will be. We expect that we will be able to both develop treatment plans faster and improve patients symptoms faster if we continually track their symptoms, hopefully engaging the “Higher Care Quality Improves Recovery” cycle. 5.2.14 Session 07 Say Checklist Today we’re modeling to learn how to evaluate our Base Case of no new decisions.

In-session Exercise (30 minutes) Running an experiment Providers know there are a lot of interdependencies that make improving care in the clinic challenging. Often, because we’re embedded in such a large care system, we may be “flying blind” with regard to how our own care decisions fit within all that is going on locally. We can use simulation to help reveal the connections and figure out which changes work, which don’t, and which are sustainable, a lot faster and safer than in the real world.

Click on ____________ under “reveal complexity” to see the systems story relevant to the experiment you decided on in the last session. In the diagram, the rectangles that look like the levels of gas that you have in your gas tank are showing states in care where patients or appointments can accumulate or drop. For example, in this team we see ___ patients in the ________ stock. The number of patients in a state are influenced by flow rates - designated by circles here that look like speedometers. For example, this ______ rate shows that about ___ patients per week in this team move from _________ to _________ \\[show with mouse work\\]. Example: First, explore the Appointments section of the diagram and see how Appointment Supply links to a number of variables. Then, examine the Patients section and notice how the different gauges and rectangles are linked and what causes them to increase or decrease. Finally see how the Patients and Appointments interact with each other, for example, by examining appointment supply and return visit interval. Remember, red means values that are read into the model from your team data. As a team, you decide what change to experiment with in the sim. To make that decision, you should ask: 1) How do we think things will change over time if make a specific change?; and 2) What relationships in the system will interact if we make that change? Ultimately, the team should choose changes that might give the desired result, based on the team vision and team need.

Practice describing specific value adjustments you expect will be helpful for the team to experiment with related to their highest priority need. 7. To create a new run building off of the previous one, revise the text in all the text boxes to reflect the experiment you want to do now. Let’s create a new experiment building off of the previous one, the base case of no new decisions. The important thing for learning is to stake a claim about your expectations, so the simulation output can teach you something. This process can also help teams to reconcile differences and achieve consensus about ways to move forward and take action for improvement. You all probably won’t agree about what the likely impact of any change will be, but we can use Modeling to Learn engage in participatory learning to find out. The first step is to revise the text in all the text boxes to reflect the experiment you want to do now: Example Questions and Hypotheses: Briefly describe what your team wants to learn from this experiment and outline the systems story your team believes will cause the outcomes your team expects to observe. CC Q: What will happen to the Starting Rate and New Patient Wait Time if we increase the Appointment Supply of care coordination appointments overall? H: Increasing the CC Appointment Supply will make more Appointments available for both new and existing CC patients. The Additional Appointment Supply for New CC Patients will increase the Starting Rate and lower New Patient Wait Times. MM Q: How could we serve more patients with specific conditions, like OUD, with our existing staffing levels? H: If our referral rate for OUD is 2 pts per month (0.5 per week), and we allocate 40% of our x-waiver slots to OUD treatment, and 40% to Other Needs, and we change our RVI for depression to 12 weeks, and the RVI for OUD to 4 weeks (in line with our quality standards), then we will serve more OUD patients with our existing team staff, without increasing the wait time for new depression patients. PSY Q: What if we graduate more patients who complete 8 or more psychotherapy sessions in their first 3 months? What is the effect of working to increase the proportion of patients who ‘complete’ an evidence-based dose of PSY and then graduate from just 4% to 75%, over time, on (1) the number of patients who complete and are then ‘done’? and (2) on the supply of available appts for new patients? H: We expect that if we increase our completers who graduate to 75%, then we’ll free up more slots in the clinic for more patients to start psychotherapy/EBPsy. We hypothesize that increasing the complete and graduate rate from 4% to 75% will result in a jump from about 4 patients to about 75 patients graduating during the same time period. We also expect that by increasing the graduation rate for any one who has received 8 or more sessions of PSY, we will increase the number of appt slots for new patients starting PSY. AGG Q: How can we manage the loss of two providers and still manage patient needs for PSY? What would happen if we change the PSY RVI to 2 weeks and the RVI for EB PSY to just 1 week (from 17 weeks)? H: We expect to see the number of PSY patients in service to go down within the first year, and then to reach a new level that is well below 300. If the numbers were down to 150 patients, then we may be able to handle the staff reduction. SP Q: How much does implementing Measurement Based Care improve our ability to get our high symptom patients into the right care at the right time? How will this change in our team impact the other settings in Mental Health? Will it kick off a virtuous cycle of GMH care quality improving recovery? H: If we more readily detect patients’ symptoms and risk, then our improvement rate will increase, moving more patients in to recovery. For this team, with their local resources and constraints, can more patients graduate from general mental health care, our patient load will drop and open more slots to start new care episodes. If we implement measurement based care in our GMH team, then care quality will improve (specifically through reductions in Time to Improve and Time to UnFlag, and an increase in the Time to Ending). Also, how long it takes clinicians to see changes in their patients will also improve (seen in a reduction in Time to Detect). We expect to be able to effectively diagnose and treat patients faster, reducing the number of high-symptom patients in care, and thus reducing the number of patients who receive high risk flags. However, low symptom patients are in care for longer than before, reducing the number of openings for new patients. These patients will make up more and more of our total – as there will be both more flowing in (due to higher Improvement Rate) and fewer flowing out (due to the lower Ending Rate). With fewer openings, wait times to start with our team should increase. 8. Adjust experiment sliders for the new experiment, keeping in mind that the previous run’s settings are in effect (for this session that just means the base case or default values). Slide the Text box to the left, over the model section. This will allow you to adjust experiment sliders for the new experiment. In the experiments section we also have experimental sliders with “i” information that tells you what you’re changing when you adjust that slider in your experiment. Keep in mind that the previous run’s settings are in effect – in this case, we have only run the bc or base case so the default values from the team data are the previous run settings. A quick tip – make note of the service or services you selected to change and the new values, that is, what you changed the numbers to, so you have that information available for naming the experiment when you save it.

Compare Experiments to see the difference the between base case and the current experimental run. Navigate to the Results Dashboard. It is here you can choose up to two prior experiments’ results to compare with the current run. Select your base case run. There are six charts in the dashboard at a time. To see the default set of charts for a specific service, cohort, or setting, go to the main model diagram Experiment Timeline box and under “Display Patient Services” click on the service, cohort, or setting for the specific charts you want to review. First, let’s look at _______ chart, in the _________ section of the screen, as it answers our question _________ . To see charts of other variables, click on the down arrows under any chart to bring up a list of all variables. Examine the differences between the base case and the current experimental run. How do these results compare against your hypothesis? As you describe the findings, record what you observe and learn in the Our Findings text box: ___Example of chart review for SP:___ In our last session, based on the team’s needs assessment, we focused on the team’s issue with long wait times stepping patients up from GMH to SMH when needed. In the bottom middle panel we can see that implementing MBC in our GMH team is likely to reduce the wait Time to Step up to SMH from approximately 45 weeks to 32 weeks over the next two years. I’ll use my mouse and click the down arrow to show you the full variable name, which is highlighted in blue. This reduction in wait times for stepping patients up to Specialty Mental Health is due to the reduction in high symptom patients over the next two years. We can see this by looking at the upper middle and upper right panels, which show how implementing MBC will improve GMH care quality: As the improvement rate increases, the ratio of high to low symptom patient decreases, fewer patients receive a high risk flag and wait times to step up to SMH decrease. However, looking at the graph in the upper left corner, patient load stays the same in our MBC experiment as it was in the base case – something prevents our virtuous cycle. The virtuous cycle of our reinforcing feedback, “Higher care quality improves recovery,” depends on the team getting patients better and moving them on from GMH. As result of our experiment, although wait times to step up form GMH to SMH go down, the lower left and right graphs show that wait times to step down to PC/PCMHI increase, and GMH patients waiting to start increases over the next two years. To summarize, yes, more of our patients are stabilizing and able to be stepped down to PC. But, we aren’t stepping them all down to PC because PC hasn’t made any new decisions in this experiment and hasn’t implemented any strategies to take on our patients. This causes longer wait times to step GMH patients down, which further reduces the number of patients the GMH team will recommend should step down for care. As we can see in the bottom left graph, the black line for our current MBC experiment shows that improvements in GMH quality due to implementing Measurement Based Care without coordinating this change with primary care will lead to increased wait-times for stepped down, and lead to the undesirable effect of patients waiting to start care in GMH as our stabilized patients build up in our GMH clinic. Thus, low symptom patients build up in our clinics. Also, PC is taking more patients than they can handle, so their quality declines, and GMH gets more patients stepping up from PC –&gt; demand for GMH goes up! Something that we think is outside of our control is actually a result of our own decision. Example Findings: Describe your team’s findings, insights and conclusions from this experiment. CC - Increasing the supply of Appointment Supply for New CC Patients does increase the new CC patient weekly Starting Rate, which reduces new CC patients Waiting to Start. MM - We found that if we allocate 50% of our x-waiver provider appointments to OUD, in the long run instead of only starting ½ patient per week (1 every other week), we can start 3 patients in OUD per week. But dropping the appointment supply for our Other patients meant we could not start any of them in care for a while until some existing patients completed and moved on. A backlog built up, which caused referrals to slow. When we were eventually able to start Other patients, the backlog dropped so referrals picked up again, and we established a new steady state with about 15 Other diagnosis patients waiting to start and about 170 in care. PSY - We found that the total number of patients served by the team increased from N=371 to N=460. Of the 460, n=358 were Initiators and n=132 were Completers. Among Completers, n=99 graduated and were done (75%, as we expected). Regarding the starting rate for new patients, it increased from about 3.8 pts/wk to about 4.8 pts/wk. our hypotheses was supported. This dramatically increases the number of patients in PSY who are receiving an evidence base dose of therapy and supports the team in taking on more new patients, about one more new pt/wk (or 4 new ones per month, or 48 new ones annually!). AGG - Our hypothesis was supported! We see that implementing a much shorter RVI for PSY patients show a steady reduction in the number of PSY patients in service, from more than 300 in our bc to less than a 100 after two years. Booking rates for PSY climb initially, but then drop off and level out just a bit higher than baseline! One concern is that MM patients in service also drops from about 1000 to 900. SP - As predicted, we see a dramatic shift in patient from “high symptom” to “low symptom,” as both detection and care quality improve – the ratio of high to low symptom patients drops from 0.6:1 to 0.2:1 over two years. The number of patients with a suicide flag decreases by more than 50%, as more high symptom patients have their symptoms addressed before they can be flagged in the first place. However, the initial predicted reduction in Ending Rate is off-set by long-term increases in the Recommend Step Down Rate, thus not permanently impacting the new patient start rate. Both new patient starts and wait times in our clinic increase in the short-term, but fall below our historical average by 3 months, and continue to fall for the next year. However, because there have been no changes in Primary Care, the number of patients waiting to step down to PC hs increased substantially – from about 110 to 170, who are all undoubtedly waiting significantly longer than before. 11. Discuss and record what changes you may want to make in the clinic and what further experiments you want to run. Based on what you saw here, and what further experiments you want to run in the Sim. Type those into the Our Decision text box. Example Decisions: Based on what you learned in this experiment, what changes are you ready to make in your practice? CC - Next time we will experiment with adjusting our Return Visit Interval. MM - Although we were glad to see that we could care for more OUD patients with our available staffing, we are concerned that if all we do is shift several of our Other appointments to OUD, we won’t be able to help as many Other patients. We decided to experiment with Return to Clinic Visit Intervals as a possible alternate solution. PSY - For our next experiment, since we have now affirmed that we have additional appt capacity for new (and existing patients), we would like to explore how changing Initiators who Complete from the base case rate of 37% to 75% might impact the number of patients who complete and graduate. This will be the only change we make, so that we can see the effect clearly. AGG - Now that we have reduced the RVI for PSY and EB PSY, we can look to see what gains in managing our patients may be achieved by rebalancing our service mix. We’ll see what happens if we invest in doing more EB PSY and less PSY, but keeping the proportion of other services more or less as before. SP - In this experiment, we see a strong connection between changes made in our team and demand and wait times for downstream teams. We should run an experiment that explores these connections, specifically to gauge the impacts of implementing stepped care between GMH and PC/PCMHI. In an interconnected system, with causal interdependencies over time, simulation can help us find out when our short-term decisions are going to make things worse in the longer term. In the real world, it would be very hard to perceive these longer term system effects, but we can see them using Modeling to Learn and we can evaluate the results against other available decisions to compare their effects and better coordinate Veterans’ care across the team to increase care quality [expand access, or reduce symptoms and risk]. 12.

Hello! I’m ________________ (facilitator’s name) and I’m _______________ (co-facilitator’s name). Today we’re modeling to learn how to make future team decisions. As you can see in the Done/Do table in the Learner See Guide: Done and Do (15 minutes) Done Do We thought about possible decisions or changes the team could make in clinical care based on our comparison of the bc, exp 1, exp 2 and exp 3 in mtl.how/sim. We will discuss the team’s learning using C.F.B.T. systems thinking skills and prioritize ways to implement new practice decisions in our clinical care. After this session you will be able to: Learning Objectives Describe what your team has prioritized as decisions to implement in your clinic. Test your team’s plan against your individual and shared team vision. Apply your team’s plan in clinical decisions using C.F.B.T. systems thinking. Let’s get started In-session Exercise (30 minutes): Pulling together team learnings, decisions, and vision Connect learning and decisions from experiments to original team vision, question, and need 1. What shared vision did the team decide on in session 1? Throughout Modeling to Learn, we’ve made lots of team decisions. Let’s review them and see what they mean for future decisions. What shared vision for Modeling to Learn did the team decide on in Session 1? We’ve tied our experiments and decisions throughout MTL to that vision. 2. What team need and questions did we identify? In sessions 2 and 3 we explored team data and trends using the MTL data UI. We learned how to find an individual patient, how to visualize trends over time for our own care or the teams’ as a whole. And we built our team data file for use in the sim. In session 4 we completed the MTL Menu to prioritize our team’s need. What questions did we identify and study over the next 5 sessions, using the sim UI to better understand the causal systems story of our team’s need over time? 3. What hypotheses did we test? 4. What insights will we keep in mind as we make clinic decisions? Let’s discuss what our Findings and Decisions mean for the team going forward. As we discuss new individual and team practice decisions keep in mind the systems thinking rationale for why a practice decision would lead to desired outcomes over time. As we discuss these questions consider Complexity, Feedback, and System Behavior over Time. What insights will we keep in mind as we make future clinic decisions? 5. What new approaches or targets do we want to focus on? Let’s think about the key insights we’ve gotten about decisions that are within our control. 6. What concrete actions will the team take in the real world? 7. How do these decisions align with the team’s shared vision, question and needs? 8. What data will we watch to see how we’re doing? That’s it for Modeling to Learn how to make future team decisions. Next is our Done/Do review. Done and Do (15 minutes) Done Do We discussed the team’s learning and new individual and team practice decisions that apply C.F.B.T. systems thinking skills in prioritized ways to implement it in our clinical care. Reflect on our team’s vision for MTL and our MTL experience to prepare for planning next steps. DO demo After we complete Modeling to Learn next time, you can still access ALL the MTL resources. You can log in to the sim UI and review all the experiments saved in the Team and Individual worlds. You can run new experiments in the same module, or in any of the other 4 MTL modules. You can log in to the data UI and look at all sorts of team and individual trends. And of course, there are many materials and links at mtl.how. For next time, as you have time, look back at those resources to refresh your memory, and be thinking about how they might be useful to you after MTL. Until next time, thank you for Modeling to Learn! 5.2.22 Session 11 Say Checklist Today we’re modeling to learn how to make future team decisions. Hello!

MTL RESOURCES You will continue to have access to the sim UI at mtl.how/sim. Remember that you can use the sim UI in two ways. You can log in to your individual world and play on your own, or the team can explore together in the team world. Let’s review the special features of each of the 5 modules and what kinds of needs they can help you think through. In Care Coordination (CC), you can compare multiple experiments and look at things like how Overwork Affects No-Shows and how you Balance New and Existing Patients. In Medication Management (MM) you can experiment with team decisions across different diagnostic cohorts and how best to allocate appointments for your providers with and without x-waivers. In Psychotherapy (PSY), you can look at different patterns of engagement that patients may follow. In the team data table for PSY, you can pull up charts to see a profile of the team’s historical patient engagement pattern; and in the Outputs section you can look at the Sankey diagram to compare patient engagement patterns and the associated appointment usage for different experiments. In the Aggregate (AGG) module, you can test hypotheses about your overall mix of services. The unique feature here is that in Outputs, you can choose to compare either different experiments (as you can in all the modules), or you can compare the effects of a given experiment across the different services. The Measurement Based Stepped Care and Suicide Prevention(SP) module allows you to run experiments involving multiple mental health care settings, to see how decisions made in one setting impact patient care and wait times across the continuum of care. Another resource is the library of MTL videos, available at mtl.how/video. For sessions 5 through 10 which involve simulation, there are recordings not just for the module your team decided to use, but for all 5. Like Modeling to Learn Live, MTL Videos are accredited through TMS for continuing education credits. Finally, you can join the Modeling to Learn Listserv at mtl.how@va.gov; and you can always email questions for MTL staff to mtl.help@va.gov. Now let’s make a plan for how the team will keep modeling to learn going forward. How could you, as a clinician, or the team as a whole, see using these resources to continue quality improvement through team decision-making? Is there another big question you’d like to explore through simulated experiments - either in the same module or a different one? Could it be helpful to refer back the model diagram as a reminder of the systems stories it tells about decisions you make as a team? Do you want to set aside some specific times - a portion of a meeting every week, or month, or quarter, say, to further explore your data and test your hypotheses? How might you share these resources with new team members, and give them a dose of systems thinking? Is there anyone who’d like to keep up their MTL skills and be a local MTL champion or coach, to remind the team of MTL when a new challenge appears on the horizon? Some teams ask for a “booster” session after a few months. We’re happy to facilitate that as well. It’s great if you make a concrete action plan, identify a point person, and call on us as needed.

It also explains how to set up Team Time (tt) report content. You Will Need to Be Registered as a Facilitator in: The Facilitator group in Epicenter. Each group you are managing. 8.1 Orientation to the Dashboard Select Team - Use this dropdown to select your desired team. It will enable you to monitor their experiments. Go to Current Session/Home - Use these buttons to go to the teams’ session. If the “Go to Current Session” button is washed out, there is no current session. Use the “Home” button to go to the teams’ Home page. Gauges - This indicates the teams’ progress with a selected experiment. Teams receive 20% completion for a minimum 50 characters input for each of the Question, Hypothesis, Findings, Decisions fields and another 20% for running the experiment. Select Experiment - Use this dropdown to select the desired experiment to monitor. An experiment will not show in this dropdown until it has been named and saved. Team Average Completion - If the team runs multiple experiments, this gauge shows the average completion of the experiments. Team Roster - Lists team members, their clinical role and team role. Team Statistics - Lists experiments, when they started and ended, total time-on-task, team size, attendance percentage and completion percentage. Team Setup - Click this button to set up a team. It provides team setup input screens and a means to load Team Data. See the section on team setup below. tt Admin - Use this button to set up the contents that will show in the tt1-3 reports. See the section on tt admin below. Manage Multiple Teams - Select additional teams to monitor using this dropdown. ADD TEAM - Click this button to add an unlimited number of teams to the dashboard. 8.2 Set Up a Team Click the “Add” button. A Team Setup popup will appear. The Team Setup will not list all teams in Epicenter. It will only list teams assigned to the facilitator. Add the team name. Just add the teams’ root name. The setup function will add “team” and “ind” extensions in Epicenter. Type the teams’ vision statement. Select the Research Arm. Click “Add” button to add a team member. A Add Team Members popup will appear. Facilitators do not need to register with the team, because the system will automatically assign based on the login. However, a co-facilitator would have to be listed and assigned to the facilitator role. Enter First Name, Last Name, Email and Clinical Role information. Use the Select Role to select team members’ role on the team. Click “Add” button. Click the checkbox next to a name and “Edit” or “Delete” to update information or delete a team member. Click “Done” button when finished. 8.3 Set up a Facilitator Individual Team (_ind) Facilitators can go into any team session where they are listed as a facilitator. The Sim UI uses that listing to build the Select Team dropdown in the Facilitator Dashboard. A Facilitator cannot be assigned a world using the same alias, so a workaround is needed. The procedure below will explain how to use an additional alias to create and access a personal individual team. After following the procedure, your individual _ind will be on your dropdown list. Navigate to Team Setup Select any _ind_team from Team Setup listing and click Edit. In the Edit Team Setup popup click Add. In the Add Team Members popup, enter your first name, last name, select Team Lead in Select Role dropdown, enter your name (example: James Rollins) again in the Enter Email field and enter your Clinical Role.
