If you do not have a GitHub account, follow these instructions: Use this YourIT link for comprehensive GitHub account access instructions. When you receive a GitHub organization or repo invitation, accept it. Lindsey must invite you to be a collaborator and you must accept the invitation (via the same email account you’ve linked to GitHub) before any contributions can be made. Once you have an activated GitHub account, you can contribute to the MTL Repo and Manual. Navigate to mtl.how. Click the master branch drop-down menu. In the “Find or create a branch…” field, type in the name of this new branch using this naming convention: feature-(meaningful_name). Example: feature-s02_partner_fidelity Note: Typing “feature-“ at the beginning of the branch name will cause linter actions to fire when committing the file (including checks for Markdown editorial rules, broken links, APA style adherence, and spelling). Congratulations! You’ve just made your own feature branch, where you can make your modifications, additions, and deletions. Navigate to and click on the file you want to modify within the feature branch you just created. Select the pencil icon (hover text: Edit this file) button. Modify the file content. Edit file tab (pencil icon): this is where you need to be to actively edit the code, play with formatting, etc. Preview tab: displays what code will look like when published. Manual files are written in Markdown, a light (i.e., simple) formatting language. Below are some examples of the syntax used for basic formatting in the manual. For more markdown formatting information, go to: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax or Google it. Element Markdown Syntax Headings #, ##, ###, ####, #####, ###### Bold ** before and after text you want boldfaced Italic _ before and after text you want italicized Bold + Italic **_ before and after text you want boldfaced and italicized Blockquote &gt; Ordered List begin line with “1.”, then a space, then your numbered item text, continue list by pressing Enter Unordered List begin line with “-”, then a space, then your bullet item text, continue list by pressing Enter Code ` before and after text you want to appear as code Horizontal Rule — Commit your file when you are done working on it by clicking the green Commit changes… button. In the Commit message field, give a brief description of your modifications (e.g., “Copied the X file into Y.” or “Added information about…”.). Use the Extended description field if needed to provide further or detailed information about your modifications. Notes: When you commit a file, you are recording changes to one or more files in your branch. Each commit is assigned a unique ID that identifies the specific changes that were made, when they were made, and who created the changes. Don’t be afraid! You’ve just committed the new file to your newly created branch. Also, nobody can “break” things in GitHub; changes can always be reverted. Do not leave your uncommitted modified markdown file overnight. Until you have committed it, there is no cloud saving and no backup. If your VPN/VA connection is lost and you have not saved, you will lose all your work in this file. 2.4.2 Contribute to the MTL Manual This manual is created using GitHub Pages (gh-pages). GitHub Pages is a web hosting service that allows users to create and host websites directly from their GitHub repositories. Navigate to mtl.how. Click the master branch drop-down menu. Select gh-pages. Note: the gh-pages branch serves as the “master” for the manuals. Create a feature branch from the gh-pages branch. Click the gh-pages drop-down menu. In the “Find or create a branch…” field, type in the name of this new branch using this naming convention: feature-gh-pages_(chapter #)_(title of chapter). Example: feature-gh-pages_chapter_7.0_mtl_technical_manual_facilitator Note: Typing “feature-“ at the beginning of the branch name will cause linter actions to fire when committing the file (including checks for Markdown editorial rules, broken links, APA style adherence, and spelling). Congratulations! You’ve just made your own feature branch, where you can make your modifications, additions, and deletions. 2.4.2.1 Edit an Existing Markdown (.md) File Navigate to and open the .md file you want to modify within the feature branch. Select the pencil icon button (hover text: Edit this file). Modify the file content. Click the Commit changes… button when you are done making modifications to the file. 2.4.2.2 Create a New Markdown File Click the Add file drop-down menu. Select Create new file. In the Name your file… field, type in the name of your new file using this naming convention: (chapter #)_(chapter title).md. The “.md” at the end of your file name is important; this file extension is how GitHub recognizes it as a Markdown file and understands formatting codes you use within your file. When creating a new chapter or subsection within the manual, be sure to number the file name accordingly. Use only lowercase. Use underscores in lieu of spaces. File names are usually the title of the chapter/subsection. In the Edit/Preview pane, develop your content. Click the Commit changes… button when you are done making modifications to the file. 2.4.3 Create a Pull Request Once you are finished committing changes to an existing file or have created a new Markdown file in the repo, it is time to create a pull request. Pull requests serve as a structured approach to managing code changes, enabling code review, discussion, testing, and documentation updates before changes are merged into the main codebase. Navigate to the Pull requests tab within GitHub. Click the green New pull request button. In the compare: drop-down menu, select the branch you modified. In the base: drop-down menu, select master. Note: You are “pulling” the changes from the right to the left. The arrow between the two fields is a good visual reminder of this. This means you are requesting information to be pulled into the master branch from the feature branch you created. As you scroll down, you can see red and green highlighted information; red = deletions, green = additions. Click the green Create pull request button. A review page will appear where you can: Add a short summary of the changes between your feature branch and the repository’s base branch. Review the changes made by commits. Add Pipelines, Reviewer/s, Assignee/s (usually you, the one making changes), Label/s, Project/s, Milestone/s, and Estimate (story points).

Home - Click to go to the selected teams’ home page. Go to Current Session - Click to access the teams’ current session. If the “Go to Current Session” button is washed out, there is no current session. Select Team - Use this dropdown to select your desired team. It will enable you to monitor their experiments. Gauges - This indicates the teams’ progress with a selected experiment. Teams receive 20% completion for a minimum 50 characters input for each of the Question, Hypothesis, Findings, Decisions fields and another 20% for running the experiment. Select Experiment - Use this dropdown to select the desired experiment to monitor. An experiment will not show in this dropdown until it has been named and saved. Manage Multiple Teams - Select additional teams to monitor using this dropdown. ADD TEAM - Click to add an unlimited number of teams to the dashboard. 7.4 Set Up a Team This section describes how a facilitator can set up a team manually, or use a Customer Management System (CMS) export to set up a team. Team setup normally occurs by the end of MTL Session 2, so the learners can access mtl.how/menu. 7.4.1 Manual Setup Click the “Add” button. A Team Setup popup will appear. The Team Setup will not list all teams in Epicenter. It will only list teams assigned to the facilitator. Add the team name. Just add the teams’ root name. The setup function will add “team” and “ind” extensions in Epicenter. Type the teams’ vision statement. Select the Research Arm. Click “Add” button to add a team member. A Add Team Members popup will appear. Facilitators do not need to register with the team, because the system will automatically assign based on the login. However, a co-facilitator would have to be listed and assigned to the facilitator role. Enter First Name, Last Name, Email and Clinical Role information. Use the Select Role to select team members’ role on the team. Click “Add” button. Click the checkbox next to a name and “Edit” or “Delete” to update information or delete a team member. Click “Done” button when finished. 7.5 Review tt Menu Results If you are a Facilitator, use your login to access the facilitator tools to access multiple team’s menu results. The system knows you are a facilitator based on your user id and will present the facilitator popup. From the popup, you can review the results of multiple teams. Navigate to mtl.how/menu. Enter login information and click “Start Survey.” Select the team from whom you want to view results from the dropdown (you may monitor three teams simultaneously). Click “Review Results” icon to the results of the team’s mtl.how/menu responses. Click “PDF” icon to download a PDF file of the report. Click “Open file” to see results in PDF format. 7.6 Set up a Facilitator Individual Team (_ind) Facilitators can go into any team session where they are listed as a facilitator. The Sim UI uses that listing to build the Select Team dropdown in the Facilitator Dashboard. A Facilitator cannot be assigned a world using the same alias, so a workaround is needed. The procedure below will explain how to use an additional alias to create and access a personal individual team. After following the procedure, your individual _ind will be on your dropdown list. Navigate to Team Setup Select desired _ind_team from Team Setup listing and click Edit. In the Edit Team Setup popup click Add. In the Add Team Members popup, enter your first name, last name, select Team Lead in Select Role dropdown, enter your name (example: James Rollins) again in the Enter Email field and enter your Clinical Role. Click Add, then Done. Your name is now your alternate alias to be used for _ind teams. Be sure to note the alias under the Email column, this will appear in the Team dropdown in the Facilitator Dashboard. ## Download Team Data and Name File for Import to Sim UI A facilitator must follow certain naming conventions, which are explained below, when downloading Team Data files. When a Team Data file is downloaded from the Data UI, it is in a specific format that the Sim UI reformats during upload. This means that if a Team Data file is downloaded from the Sim UI and then re-uploaded to the Sim UI it will not work! The facilitator will be able assign the Team Data file to various teams and worlds of their choice from the Facilitator Dashboard in the Sim UI. See next section. Type mtl.how/data into your Chrome, Edge, Safari or Firefox browser. Navigate to the desired Region and VISN. Select and apply clinical and/or team flow data. In left-hand navigation, scroll down to “Team Data for SimUI” and click. After the file builds, click on the ellipses on the right side and click “Export data.” Select default “Data with current layout” and click “Export.” The Team Data file is exported to your browser’s download location. Open file location and rename file using the convention “Sta3n-number_geo-location_clinic_year_month_day.” Upload data into Sim UI. 7.7 Manage Team Data In the Facilitator Dashboard, click on Team Setup in the middle right-hand side of the dashboard. Click the “Add” button to add a new team data file and select the Individual (Ind), Team, and Shared worlds that the file needs to be uploaded to. A “Select Worlds” popup will appear. Select the worlds, within which, the team data will appear. When finished, click “Done.” The File Manager will appear, go to the desired file location and click on the file. Click “Open” to upload the file. Please Note. The upload routine must update multiple GitHub repositories and Epicenter, which may take a few minutes. If the file does not appear, try clicking the “Refresh” button. Do not attempt to upload Team Data file directly to Epicenter, since the GitHub repository will overwrite the files on the next update and they will not work when you try to access them from the Sim UI. 7.8 Produce team_time report This section explains how to use the Facilitator Dashboard to set up and manage team time (tt) reports. 7.8.1 Set up a Blue tt Report The tt Reports popup allows you to select your team, select experiments to display and the specific charts you want to display in the report. For the Psychotherapy Module, Sankey charts are displayed by default. Psychotherapy charts active in the Sim UI Team Data Table are also active in the tt report Team Data Table. A team can have only one module at a time displayed on the tt report. If you choose a different module, it will re-render the tt report page to the selected module. Select tt Admin from the Facilitator Dashboard. The tt Reports popup will appear. tt 1 Report: If you are producing the 1st tt report, skip to step 5 by signing into mtl.how/menu. See Managing tt Menu Results section above for more information. Select your team and the module they are using from the dropdowns. tt 3 Report: If you are producing the last tt report, check the tt3 box. Experiments should populate under the Select Experiments section with the teams’ saved experiments. Select your desired experiments. Checked experiments will appear in the Display list. If you are changing experiments only, be sure to scroll down and click and click the Save button. Regardless of the list order, experiments will be displayed oldest to newest in the tt report. You can select up to 10 experiments for comparison. Under Select Reports, check the boxes of charts you want to display. Selected charts will appear on the Display list to the right. Click Save when done. The charts will display in order of appearance on the list in the tt report. Sign into mtl.how/menu and select your team. Click on the PDF icon on the upper right-hand side of the page to download an export of your tt report. The page will load for a few seconds before giving you an option to download your report by clicking Save As. 7.8.2 Set up a Red TT Report The NIH-Red tt report only contains team data. Do not select charts to display. Team data cannot be read directly, it must be converted to an experiment. There is a special button in the Team Setup popup for the team data to experiment conversion. The team data file must be uploaded before using this procedure. Select Team Setup from the Facilitator Dashboard. The Set Setup popup will appear. Select the team data file you want to use in the Red tt report and click the Add to tt button. Select the desired model. Select the desired team from the dropdown and click Done. Close the Team Setup popup and click on the tt Admin button. The tt Admin popup will appear. Select the desired team and modules from the dropdowns. Select the tt red experiment to display in the teams’ report. Scroll down and click Save. Sign into mtl.how/menu and select your team. Click on the PDF icon on the upper right-hand side of the page to download an export of your tt report. The page will load for a few seconds before giving you an option to download your report by clicking Save As. 7.9 Manage Discussions in Team The Team button in the top navigation is for texting and maintaining private discussion threads with one or more individuals and open discussion threads with teams. A person can chat with one or more people using the Team function by inputting the end user name (usually the va.gov email address) of the person or people they want to address. A person can chat with an entire team at once, provided they are a registered end user in that team. 7.9.1 Set up a Private Conversation Click “Team” to open the chat popup. Click Chat in the left-hand navigation to private-text an individual. The latest conversation will appear in the Chat Log, followed the next recent. The discussion thread appears in the Conversation window. To continue a conversation, type a new message in the message line at the bottom of the window. Click the send icon to post the chat. To start a conversation with one or more new people, click the New icon and enter their user name and click Add. Type a new message and click send. 7.9.2 Set up an Open Team Discussion Click on the Team icon in the left-hand navigation. Note how the icon has a red circle indicating there are 2 chats waiting. The Teams listing will contain a list of all teams the individual is a registered end user (see blue-green highlight). A boldface team indicates a chat is waiting. **Note the listing contains _ind teams. These are teams where users are assigned an individual world with which to experiment. However, any discussions held in this thread will be visible by all registered users from their different worlds.** To have a private chat with an individual, see Set up a Private Conversation above. 7.10 Resize a Window for Side-by-Side Viewing A facilitator may need to show two items on the screen side-by-side for comparison. The Sim UI has a responsive design that should accommodate many resolutions and browser window sizes. Follow the steps below to get the best view. Click the “window” icon in the upper right of the browser window. Drag the browser window to the desired size. Notice how the Sim UI design responds by stacking top navigation menu icons. Sometimes items on the screen are cutoff or not formatted correctly. Click the refresh button so the browser can detect the new window size and adjust the format. If the format is still not optimum, decrease the zoom below 100% to reduce the size of the items on the screen, or drag the screen slightly larger. 7.11 Report a Bug There are two ways to report a bug; through the Sim UI and directly into GitHub. One must have access to either the Sim UI or GitHub in order to report a bug. 7.11.1 Report a bug through the Sim UI From the Home Page or from the Play Page - Click on the “Report Bug” icon. Describe the issue in the field provided (please be detailed as possible). Do not include PII or other Site identifiable information.

While the Sim UI can manage most administrator-user needs within the web interface, sometimes it is necessary to go directly into Epicenter to, for example, set up a new end-user in Epicenter. Click Epicenter to go to the login. 8.7.1 Send Password Reset to End User 8.7.1.1 Select End User from Menu You can search for the user by using the search bar. 8.7.1.2 Click on the Password Reset You can also change the password directly for the user by selecting the “Change Password” from the dropdown. 8.7.2 Set up A New Epicenter End User 8.7.2.1 Navigate to A Project Note that you would navigate to various projects to set up end users in different instances of the Sim UI. For example, you would navigate to VA Sim UI-TEST-Slow to set an end-user up in the TEST environment. 8.7.2.2 Navigate to Group Page In the Epicenter hierarchy, “groups” are the highest entity. Underneath groups are worlds. In TeamPSD, we refer to groups as “teams.” Typically, we auto-setup a _team group and a _ind group to manage team assignments and individual worlds. 8.7.2.3 Select Desired Group 8.7.2.4 Click Add End User Button 8.7.2.5 Add User Email to Field and Click “Add/invite User” Button We usually put the user’s VA email address in this field. However, it does not have to be an email unless you are sending a notice via email to the user. Sometimes users just need an alias besides their email address. 8.7.3 Set up a team We don’t set up teams directly in Epicenter anymore, because there are multiple dependencies in the Sim UI that would be bypassed. See chapter 7.3 for more information about setting up a team on the Facilitator Dashboard. 8.7.4 Set up an Admin To set up an Admin, the end-user id must be assigned to the administrator_login group on the groups page.
