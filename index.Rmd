Hi, I'm Lindsey and this is Debbie. You might wonder what is _Modeling to Learn_, why use it, and how might it help? We often don't understand what is driving our care problems over time. _Modeling to Learn_ helps to upgrade the decisions you make all day, every day, because the decisions made most frequently will be the most powerful for improving our care. We're introducing _Modeling to Learn_, which has been developed and evaluated in the VA for over 9 years. _Modeling to Learn_ is a way to upgrade care decisions by understanding the dynamics of common care problems over time. Are you very, very busy? _Modeling to Learn_ includes step by step guides with gifs showing each click. These guides are available at [mtl.how](mtl.how). Are you unsure what data to use, how it's defined, and are you wishing it was current enough to guide your care decisions? _Modeling to Learn_ includes a transparent, real-time locally defined data user interface available at [mtl.how/data](mtl.how/data), where you specify the clinics that define your data views. Are you unsure what is realistic for improving care locally, given your patients’ needs and your existing staff and resources? _Modeling to Learn_ also includes a simulation modeling interface available at [mtl.how/sim](mtl.how/sim), so you can try out new decisions before you implement them in the clinic. We all want to meet Veterans needs for timely, high-quality care. So, what gets in our way? Watch that video to find out.

Hi, I'm Lindsey and this is David. _Modeling to Learn_ improves visibility and provides new insights into how common care problems persist over time. How? _Modeling to Learn_ is based on over 60 years of scholarship known as participatory system dynamics. For this reason, we call ourselves Team PSD for Team Participatory System Dynamics. The Data User Interface and Simulation User Interface comprise two versions of _Modeling to Learn_. The data-only version is known as _Modeling to Learn_ Red; _Modeling to Learn_ Blue ads participatory learning from simulation. Team PSD supports _MTL_ Red and _MTL_ Blue and is carefully evaluating how each works to support VA in meeting Veterans needs. Learning from simulation can help us to place a better initial bet on what is likely to work locally by evaluating alternative decisions via simulation before we implement them in the real world. _MTL_ Red tells us where we've been over the last two years based on the clinic selections made to produce the patient data reports and team trends or visualizations. Many staff report that viewing the Data UI real-time patient data tabs or the team trends is efficient and encouraging. The data tabs help with clinical decision making. The visualizations of team trends provide leading indicators that improvement efforts are paying off, which can be validating.

## What gets in the way of meeting patients' needs?

Hi, I'm Lindsey and this is David. We all want to meet Veterans’ needs for timely, high-quality care. So, what gets in our way? _Modeling to Learn_ is a way to upgrade care decisions by understanding the dynamics of common care problems over time. Demanding clinical days mean we don't often have bandwidth to gain new insights, particularly in our understanding of interdependent clinic dynamics over time. We're often flying blind to the impacts that our daily decisions have on the overall community that relies on us. As clinicians, we look at the patient in front of us and decide when we think they should be seen again. But have you ever been told you cannot see a patient as soon as you would like due to the constraints of the clinic? For example, an evidence-based course of care requires starting treatment without delay and keeping the Veteran engaged in a therapeutic dose of care over time to meet their needs. If we only emphasize Veterans starting care, but the time between visits extends way out, this interferes with evidence-based care and Veterans getting better. How can we get more Veterans better without adding hours in our day? Watch that video to find out.

Hi, I'm Lindsey and this is Debbie. Leaders and clinicians often ask how can _Modeling to Learn_ be useful when facing critical staffing and hiring needs? With limited staff coverage, the need to hire is priority number one, but even then there isn't a magic wand that produces staff where they may not exist today. What could help now? From the beginning, _Modeling to Learn_ prioritized evidence-based episodes of care within existing staff time. When modeling to learn launched nationally in the VA in March of 2020, it was to empower staff to find the highest yield local improvements without asking staff to do more with less. As a result, when staff coverage may not change quickly, _Modeling to Learn_ will find options for improving quality of care for Veterans and quality of work life for providers. How? What does Debbie mean by high yield local improvements? Because evidence-based behavioral healthcare is delivered over time, there are many possibilities. Small decisions made all day, every day by the clinicians, when compounded over time, can be surprisingly powerful. Think of your savings account or your waistline. In _Modeling to Learn_, we look for the lightest clinical lift teams and VAs can make that have the biggest payoff for Veterans in terms of timely, high-quality care. We work hard to avoid big difficult changes with limited benefit. When working with the _Modeling to Learn_-read data user interface, clinical teams are often motivated when they see trends that reflect hard-won efforts to implement high quality episodes of care which may not show up in other data systems for some time. The _Modeling to Learn_ Blue simulation user interface saves staff time because alternatives can quickly be assessed during a modeling consultation. Change is hard, but we no longer have to learn by trial and error, wearing out already burdened staff. Does that sound too good to be true? If so, you may be wondering about examples of _Modeling to Learn_ use cases for the pain points you face in your specific team or program. As an example, how does _Modeling to Learn_ benefit substance use disorder, or SUD programs? Watch that video to find out.
