### A. There are 3 primary facilitation goals and emphases across the 12-Session plan.

_MTL_ Sessions | Primary Goal | Emphasis | Team Time Report
-- | -- | -- | --
**1-4** | **Partner** to identify and validate the team's highest priority learning need now. | **participatory learning** | **tt1**
**5-8** | **Build** capacity for participatory learning from simulation using team question/hypothesis/findings/decisions. | **participatory learning + systems thinking** | **tt2**
**9-12** | **Apply** C.F.B.T. systems thinking and plan for future team learning needs. Ideally, the team has been practicing new decisions and may also now be ready to implement a shared change in the real world. | **systems thinking** | **tt3**

### B. There are 3 intersession timestamp checklists used across the 12-session plan.

**Checklist** | **Sessions** | **30-35 Minute Exercise Timestamp Script**
-- | -- | -- 
**1** | **Sessions 1-4** | **Participatory Learning** 
**2** | **Sessions 5-10** | **Participatory Simulation Learning**
**3** | **Sessions 11-12** | **Wrap-up and Future Learning**

### C. How to "Prioritize" and "Practice" during the intersession: 

### Intersession Overview

- **Identify team-tailored priorities** based on the _Modeling to Learn_ theory of change first. 
- Then, **fill in the session SAY guide,** triaging what you will SAY, by narrowing down to what you've prioritized and practiced to fit within the **timestamps** below.

| Steps |
| -- |
| 1. Use the **intersession guide** to identify the **team priorities** you will **practice.** |
| 2. **Fill in the SAY guide for that session** based on the priorities you identify. |
| 3. **Practice the highest priority tailoring** to fit within the **timestamps.** |

### Intersession Purpose
- **The intersession checklist is used by co-facilitators to ensure the goals and emphases of the _MTL_ theory of change are prioritized and practiced when tailoring to your team's highest priority need.**

1. The intersession **_checklist_** provides co-facilitator guidance for tailoring the  MTL 12-session plan to their team.
2. The intersession **_meeting_** uses the intersession checklist to prioritize and practice tailoring the SAY files to your team within the timestamps according to the _MTL_ theory of change.
3. Intersession **_preparation_** should help you to prioritize and practice key emphases of **participatory learning** and **systems thinking** related to the team's priority need from session 1 through session 12 of the 12-session plan.

### 1. What you need 

| Before you begin, you need to |
| -- |
| 1. **Download or print** the SAY checklist to fill in blanks for your team's highest priority need. |
| 2. **Review post-session checklist** notes **especially #6** from the prior session. |
| 3. **Review** the **_MTL_ Partner, Build, or Apply Fidelity Checklist** to ensure high fidelity ratings. |

| To complete the intersession checklist, you need to |
| -- |
| 1. **Apply the 4 "prioritize prompts** from the intersession guide to the SAY file. | 
| 2. **Clarify Co-Facilitator Roles** - Choose a "**_Live Lead_**" - The _live lead_ drives on-screen until handing off to the team lead. Choose a "**_Fidelity Facilitator_**" - The _fidelity facilitator_ ensures that key goals and priorities are emphasized on-time to maintain fidelity." |
| 3. **Practice your priorities** from the intersession guide using the intersession and SAY file timestamps. |

### 2. Sessions 1-4 Goals and Emphases - Partner to identify the team's highest priority learning need now. [participatory learning]

1. **Review** the _MTL_ Partner Fidelity Checklist and overview below.
2. **Introduce** the overarching _MTL_ Learning Objectives and identify a shared team vision for _Modeling to Learn_.
3. **Review** hyper local transparent team data resources related to the team's learning vision.
4. **Dialogue** about the team's highest priority learning need now using the _MTL Menu_

Session | Priority| Participatory Learning 
-- | -- | --
s1 | Shared Vision | The team practices making team decisions as they move from an individual to shared vision, select their team lead and team meeting time
s2 | Team Data Trends | The team learns to evaluate their own team data trends and patient data in relation to their team vision.
s3 | Team Data for Simulation | The team selects the data that makes sense for their own context and shared vision, and builds the set of parameters they will use for "what if" simulation learning.
s4 | Team Need | The team engages in a dialogue about the highest priority team need now, so that there is consensus around the _MTL_ Learning Module selected for sessions 5-10.

### 6. Sessions 9-12 Goals and Emphases - Use C.F.B.T. Systems Thinking and plan for future team learning needs and ready team to implement a tested change in the real world. [systems thinking]

1. **Review** the _MTL_ Apply Fidelity Checklist and overview below.
2. **Identify** the new _MTL_ capacities for each session consistent with the _MTL_ theory of change.
3. **Target** the next level of systems thinking for the team based on their question, hypothesis, findings and decisions boxes for that session, specifically these four C.F.B.T. systems thinking attributes:

C.F.B.T. | Systems Thinking | Considers
-- | -- | --
Complex | **Forest not trees.** | Relationships among two or more variables (wait times, improvement rate), or two or more settings (primary care, general mental health).
Feedback | **Loop not line. Not simple cause and effect.** | The end of the story often influences the beginning, and is strengthened (reinforcing) or reduced (balancing) around the loop.
System Behavior | **Movie not snapshot.** | Trends over time.  Systems cause their own behavior through feedback.
|Time | **Short and long term.** | Better understanding of change over time (e.g., worse before better, better before worse).

### 8. Summary of principles for team tailoring SAY guides in ways consistent with the _MTL_ theory of change during the intersession.

#### Prioritize

- **Align** the team-specific tailoring with the **goals** and **emphases** of the sessions according the **_MTL_ Theory of Change.**
- **Prioritize continuity across sessions** from the **team vision,** **team data** and **team need.** (MTL sessions 1-4).
from session to session, (“last time we talked about…”; “so-and-so asked about…”). 
- **Clarify Co-Facilitator Roles** - Choose a Live Lead and a Pre/Post Lead/Note-taker.
  
#### Practice

**Practice the highest priorities from the interesssion checklist** - ensure they can be communicated to the time within the timestamps.
- **Prepare** the specific examples and explanations tailored the team's need, including the mousework and rationale in the SAY guide.
- **Practice** to ensure your examples work within the time-frame. 
- **Rehearse** active listening skills. 
- **Quiz** each other on FAQ/anticipated questions from the team for the upcoming session.
