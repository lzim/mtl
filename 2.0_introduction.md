### Contribute to the _MTL_ Repo and Manual

**Note:** You must have an activated GitHub account before making contributions. If you do not have a GitHub account, follow these instructions:

1. Use [this YourIT link](https://yourit.va.gov/va?sys_kb_id=ac83cb5d1be87d14018220a5624bcb41&id=kb_article_view&sysparm_rank=1&sysparm_tsqueryId=420cec1687823914e99f77f5cebb35bd) for comprehensive GitHub account access instructions.
2. When you receive a GitHub organization or repo invitation, [accept it](https://yourit.va.gov/va?sys_kb_id=ed13eadf1b41b19467556242604bcbcb&id=kb_article_view&sysparm_rank=3&sysparm_tsqueryId=420cec1687823914e99f77f5cebb35bd).
3. Lindsey must invite you to be a collaborator and you must accept the invitation (via the same email account you’ve linked to GitHub) before any contributions can be made.

Once you have an activated GitHub account, you can contribute to the _MTL_ Repo and Manual.

1. Navigate to mtl.how.
2. Click the master branch drop-down menu.
3. In the “Find or create a branch…” field, type in the name of this new branch using this naming convention: feature-(meaningful_name).
   - Example: feature-s02_partner_fidelity
   - **Note:** Typing “feature-“ at the beginning of the branch name will cause linter actions to fire when committing the file (including checks for Markdown editorial rules, broken links, APA style adherence, and spelling).
   - Congratulations! You’ve just made your own feature branch, where you can make your modifications, additions, and deletions.
4. Navigate to and click on the file you want to modify within the feature branch you just created.
5. Select the pencil icon (hover text: Edit this file) button.
6. Modify the file content.
   - Edit file tab (pencil icon): this is where you need to be to actively edit the code, play with formatting, etc.
   - Preview tab: displays what code will look like when published.
   - Manual files are written in Markdown, a light (i.e., simple) formatting language. Below are some examples of the syntax used for basic formatting in the manual. For more markdown formatting information, go to: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax or Google it.

| Element | Markdown Syntax |
| ------- | ------- |
| Headings | #, ##, ###, ####, #####, ###### |
| Bold | ** before and after text you want boldfaced |
| Italic | _ before and after text you want italicized |
| Bold + Italic | **_ before and after text you want boldfaced and italitized |
| Blockquote | > |
| Ordered List | begin line with "1.", then a space, then your numbered item text, continue list by pressing Enter |
| Unordered List | begin line with "-", then a space, then your bullet item text, continue list by pressing Enter |
| Code | ` before and after text you want to appear as code |
| Horizontal Rule | --- |

7. Commit your file when you are done working on it by clicking the green Commit changes… button.
   - In the Commit message field, give a brief description of your modifications (e.g., “Copied the X file into Y.” or “Added information about…something or other.”).
   - Use the Extended description field if needed to provide further or detailed information about your modifications.
   - **Notes:**
     - When you “commit” a file, you are recording changes to one or more files in your branch. Each commit is assigned a unique ID that identifies the specific changes that were made, when they were made, and who created the changes.
     - Don’t be afraid! You’ve just committed the new file to your newly created branch. Also, nobody can "break" things in GitHub; changes can always be reverted.
     - Do not leave your uncommitted modified markdown file overnight. Until you have committed it, there is no cloud saving and no backup. If your VPN/VA connection is lost and you have not saved, you will lose all your work in this file. 

### Create a Pull Request

1. Navigate to the Pull requests tab within GitHub.
2. Click the green New pull request button.
3. In the compare: drop-down menu, select the branch you have been modifying.
4. In the base: drop-down menu, select master.
   - **Note:** While this may seem strange, you are “pulling” the changes from the right to the left. The arrow between the two fields is a good reminder of this..
   - This means you are requesting information to be pulled into the master branch from the feature branch you created.
   - As you scroll down, you can see red and green highlighted information; red = deletions, green = additions.

5. Click the green Create pull request button.
6. A review page will appear where you can:
   - Add a short summary of the changes between your feature branch and the repo’s base branch.
   - Review the changes made by commits.
   - Add Pipelines, Reviewe/rs, Assignee/s (usually you, the one making changes), Label/s, Project/s, Milestone/s, and Estimate (story points).
