### Make, View, and Export Team Clinic Selections for Import to Sim UI

**Tip:** Refer to (or save) the one-page [Data Cheatsheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/mtl/gh-pages/images/mtl_how_3.7_data_cheatsheet.pdf) when using the Data UI and making clinic and flow selections. 

The general workflow for the Data UI is that teams:

- Select their clinics and team flow (if applicable).

- Review and look at the data and viz tabs to observe trends in the clinics.

- Generate the Data UI file from Power BI to export into the Sim UI.

**Notes:**

- All users must follow certain naming conventions, which are explained below, when downloading Team Data files.

- When a Team Data file is downloaded from the Data UI, it is in a specific format that the Sim UI **reformats during upload.** This means that if a Team Data file is downloaded from the Sim UI and then re-uploaded to the Sim UI **it will not work!**

- Clinic selections and data tabs refresh every night.

- Viz tabs update monthly at the beginning of the month. 

1. Open Chrome, Edge, Safari, or Firefox browser and go to [mtl.how/data](https://app.powerbigov.us/groups/me/apps/b9686a29-6857-46c9-bdf9-043ca2b29138?ctid=e95f1b23-abaf-45ee-821d-b7ab251ab3bf).

<img alt="Image of browser address bar with an arrow pointing to mtl.how/data." src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/mtl/gh-pages/images/mtl_data_nav.png">

2. Using the left-hand navigation pane, navigate to the desired Region and VISN.

<img alt="Image of _Modeling to Learn_ Data UI home page with an arrow pointing to left-hand navigation pane." src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/mtl/gh-pages/images/mtl_data_visn_nav.png">

3. Click on the Clinic Selection tab and select and view your local team data.

<img alt="Image of Clinic Selection window with arrows pointing to possible filters." src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/mtl/gh-pages/images/mtl_data_select_data.png">

- Filter by Division Name, Physical Location, PrimaryStopCode, SecondaryStopCode, and/or Is an Active Clinic? (de-activated clinics denoted by ZZ) in the left and middle columns.

- Search and filter for your team's clinics by clinic name or by provider in the Select Clinics to Generate Report Data column after making selections in the left and middle columns.

- Click the green Apply button to pull Patient Level Data from all clinics selected in the last two years.

- Select clinics that your team refers to in the Team Flow Selection tab to produce data tracking patients stepped up/down for the Team Flow module.

  - For example, if you are a GMH team, you would select SMH in the dropdown for "The clinics selected below that my team refers to are" and add the SMH clinics your team refers to in the Green column, second row.

  - In the bottom right-hand columns for the three possible care settings (GMH, SMH, PC/PCMHI) indicate the threshold for minimum gap in patient care required for subsequent visit to be considered a new care episode. In general, for the (GMH or SMH or PC/PCMHI) setting, how long of a gap in patient care is required for the subsequent visit to be considered a new care episode? Set the threshold below in months. The default threshold is 9 months (39 weeks).

- Click Apply.

  **Notes:** 

  - Are the clinics and data not populating? Request and verify your local server views by following steps outlined in [Request and Verify Local Server View Permissions](#request-and-verify-local-server-view-permissions).

  - If you wish to have quick access to these Clinic Selections in the future, you can make a personal bookmark to return to it. Go to the Bookmarks drop-down menu and click on Add a personal bookmark. In the bookmark name field, use Team PSD convention for the name: Sta3n_Division Name_Date (date in yyyy_mm_dd format), then select Save.

<img alt="Image of Personal Bookmarks - Add a personal bookmark navigation." src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/mtl/gh-pages/images/mtl_data_bookmark.png">

7. The Team Data file is exported to your browser's download location. Save using our Team naming convention "Sta3n_geo-location_clinic_year_month_day" and post the file on the shared Team channel for Team members to view and confirm selections. 

<img alt="Image of team data file saved with Team naming convention." src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/mtl/gh-pages/images/mtl_data_file_name.png">

8. Repeat steps 2-6 with Team Flow Selections.

**Tips & Tricks:**

- Link to [CPT Code Cheatsheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/mtl/gh-pages/images/cptcode_cheatsheet.png).

- Use the most recent clinic selection table to find the full Sta6a. The folder for the site list xlsb file is located in the TeamPSD shared drive > Grants > 0_final_post_covid19_site_list.

  **Note:** This site list is for SMEs and the internal team; **it is _not_ applicable for field users**.

- To clear filters/columns, click on the Eraser icon in the upper right of the filters/columns.

- To reset ALL selections across ALL tabs, click the Reset button in the upper right hand of the bar.

<img alt="Image of highlighted Reset button and Eraser icons." src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/mtl/gh-pages/images/mtl_data_eraser_reset.png">

- To zoom into the screen, hover in the upper right-hand corner of the screen until a set of icons appear.

  - Click on the square Focus Mode icon. Click Back to Report to return to the previous view.

  **Note:** Focus Mode is found in the data and viz tabs only. 

<img alt="Image of highlighted Focus Mode icon found within data and viz tabs." src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/mtl/gh-pages/images/focus_mode.png">

9. Click to view the vizDiag tab which shows team trends.

- Viz tabs are your reference modes - trends over time.

- Zoom out and see team trends for diagnoses (Diag), encounters (Enc), health factor data (HF; e.g., suicide plans, evidence-based practice templates), measures (Meas), and behavioral and suicide risks (Flag) from Mental Health Assistant. Click on the respective tabs (Diag, Enc, etc.) to view these trends.

- Another way to see encounters or services decreasing or increasing is by viewing the number of visits by right clicking on any trend line and click Show As Table.

- Filter trends to zoom into a specific team trend by navigating to the right side of the screen and click on the Funnel icon to reveal the filter panel.

- vizDiag in the Data UI shows a trend lines by diagnoses or combination of diagnoses. For example, the PTSD line is for patients with only PTSD. The PTSD & AUD line is for patients with both these diagnoses but does not discriminate between which is the primary, secondary, etc. diagnoses.

**Tips & Tricks:** 

- Right click on any trend line and click Show As Table to see encounters or services decrease or increase by viewing the number of visits.

- Filter trends to zoom into a specific team trend by navigating to the right side of the screen and click on the "Funnel" icon to reveal the filter panel.

- If you do not see something that you would expect or previously saw, check to see if a filter is applied.

- Click on the funnel icon in the top upper right. Filters are active if it says "Filters and slicers affecting this visual."

10. Click to view the “data” tabs, which show your team’s individual patient information. 

- In the data tabs, providers can zoom in on specific veterans. Patient information corresponds to the same categories as the team trends: diagnoses (Diag), encounters (Enc), health factor data (HF; e.g., suicide plans, evidence-based practice templates), measures (Meas), and behavioral and suicide risks (Flag) from Mental Health Assistant.

- Providers can filter to find specific patients or produce reports by navigating to the right side of the screen and clicking on the "Funnel" icon to reveal the filter panel.

**Tips & Tricks:**

- dataDiag in the Data UI has an additional column after Diagnoses of Interest, called Primary Diagnoses, specifying which diagnosis is primary to help providers better understand the characteristics of the patient population.

- Patients who have requested restricted access to their information have asterisks (******) in the Patient Name column. If you are a VA provider, you can still identify patients from the Patient SSN column, or Patient Name column.

- If you do not see something that you would expect or previously saw, check to see if a filter is applied.

  - Click on the funnel icon in the top upper right. Filters are active if it says "Filters and slicers affecting this visual."

### Begin a Session in the Dynamic Decision Dashboard

**Tip:** Refer to this one-page [Sim UI Cheatsheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/mtl/gh-pages/images/mtl_how_3.7_sim_ui_cheatsheet.png) when familiarizing yourself with the Dynamic Decision Dashboard.

Beginning a session in the Dynamic Decision Dashboard (DDD) allows users to look at the stocks and flows across all five modules. It also helps determine which module(s) to prioritize, based on the location of the greatest accumulation to leverage for change.

Learners can see the same accumulations and learn where to prioritize based on the location of the greatest accumuation to leverage for change.

1. Navigate to the selected team's Home page. If you aren't sure how, see [Navigate to the Home Page of Any Team](#navigate-to-the-home-page-of-any-team).

2. Select the desired team data file from the Please Select Team Data dropdown and click GO! A Learning Mode pop-up will appear.

**Tip:** If multiple members of a team want to review the DDD at the same time, it is **highly recommended to take turns initializing** (pressing Go!). Otherwise, some users may not be able to successfully initialize the DDD modules.

**Notes:**
- Team PSD members will have uploaded the same Team Data file into the _team world for everyone at that consult location.
  - Learners can see the same accumulations and learn where to prioritize based on the location of the greatest accumuation to leverage for change.
  - Although learners see the same information, it is still your own unique session (behind the scenes).
  - There are ways to play in the same world and learn together within each module: Care Coordination, Team Care, Medication Management, Psychotherapy, and Team Flow.

- If there is not a team data file in the dropdown, follow [these steps](#upload-team-data-files-from-the-home-page).

<img alt="Image of team Home page with arrows showing how to begin a session." src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/mtl/gh-pages/images/home_page_select_data.png">

5. Return to [Begin a Session in the Dynamic Decision Dashboard, Step 2](#begin-a-session-in-the-dynamic-decision-dashboard).

### Dynamic Decision Dashboard

The Dynamic Decision Dashboard (DDD) is a convenient visual way to help answer the question  _Where is the volume (of Veterans) across all modules?_ The DDD is for _everyone_ (clinicians, consultants, nurses, etc.) to test their assumptions and hypotheses. The primary purpose of these visuals is to help understand the dynamic system that is Veteran care. The dashboard shows a visual representation of where Veterans accumulate (creating lags in the system), where Veterans are waiting to start, and the services in which these behaviors are observed.  This aids in understanding how different quantities change and interact over time and identifying key variables that contribute to the accumulation or depletion of stocks. The DDD allows clinicians to make new clinical decisions that are among their most common decisions, resulting in high-leverage change(s) that are the most influential decisions that impact the behaviors of the Veteran care system, and empowers teams to understand how to zoom in to get a particular Veteran the right treatment at the right time or zoom out to understand how all the individual decisions aggregate over time to determine the dynamics of the system.

#### Understand the Five Modules

There are five modules within the Dynamic Decision Dashboard, each of which is described below:

**Care Coordination:** shows how a variety of team decisions interact to impact multiple outcomes at the same time. You can explore trade-offs between decisions such as desired new patient wait times, current patient return visit intervals, and overbooking, and how they affect team outcomes like total missed appointments, number of patients in care, and number of patients completing care.

**Team Care:** gives insights about RVI and service proportions, and shows how a variety of team decisions interact to affect your overall mix of services. You can explore trade-offs between decisions such as desired new patient wait times, current patient return visit intervals, and overbooking, and how they affect team outcomes like total missed appointments, number of patients in care, and number of patients completing care. You can compare the effects of different decisions on outcomes in one service, or you can compare the effects of one decision on different services.

**Medication Management:** enables you to experiment with how team decisions about referrals, time allocation, and visit frequency impact the quality of medication management for patients. Your team can explore scenarios to balance these trade-offs and better meet the specific needs of patients with depression, alcohol use disorder, and opioid use disorder. Insights you gain can help you increase local reach of evidence-based pharmacotherapies.

**Psychotherapy:** shows how team psychotherapy decisions interact and depicts patterns of psychotherapy engagement in your team. You can explore solutions to the challenges of getting patients to complete a full course of therapy, while also achieving goals to start enough new patients in psychotherapy. Insights about these dynamics can be used to increase the local reach of evidence-based psychotherapies.

**Team Flow:** shows the effects of measurement-based stepped care on patients' symptoms and risk. It allows you to explore the impacts of implementing measurement-based care to reduce delays in detecting patients at high risk for suicide, and to improve the quality of care by making better team decisions about when to step patients up to a higher level of care, or step them down to a lower level of care. It is also possible to experiment with team decisions related to new patient wait times and access, the use of community care, and the impacts of provider overwork and burnout on the quality of care.

#### Orient to the Dynamic Decision Dashboard

10. **Community:** Click here to participate by sharing an idea, letting the team know what you like, asking a question, or joining our community.

##### Feedback Loops

A systems view and understanding is reinforced through the use of funcational causal loop diagrams accessible directly from the DDD. These diagrams are interactive and help visualize how different variables within the system of veteran care are causally interrelated. Feedback loops involve the output of a system being fed back into the system as input. They are essential for understanding and analyzing the behavior of dynamic systems. 

Each story has its own unique feedback loop that shows named balancing and reinforcing feedback loops and the whole system story with polarities. For illustrative purposes, the Team Flow Story is used as an example below (with all causal loop dynamics shown) to orient you to general feedback loop window features. 

<img alt="Image of an example feedback loop, Team Flow Story." src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/mtl/gh-pages/images/feedback_loop_popup.png">

11. **R Reinforcing Loop:** This is a reinforcing loop; it reinforces runaway increase or decrease - virtuous or vicious behavior.

12. **B Balancing Loop:** This is a balancing loop; it keeps things in balance - stable or stubborn behavior.

13. **Window Size:** Click and drag to resize this window.

14. **Exit:** Click to close this window.

##### Decision Meters

Decision Meters are a quick infographic-based way to identify the highest leverage points and are highly supportive of clinical decision-making; they are for "decider" users who need systems thinking insights. The meters provide a visual interface that provides real-time feedback on ranges in our primary _MTL_ units of patients/week and appointments/week. The traffic light reflects the current state results and _recommendation_ of future state results. Through dialogue with decision-makers, consultants and field users manually input values into this graphic generator so the decision meters reflect the recommendations based on the alternative scenarios/experiments run by the learner. Decision meter numbers should be reflected in the "D" box of the Q/H/F/D outputs text field within the Sim UI, usually as ranges of numbers. 

- Care Decision Meters are for _MTL Blue_ teams only.
- Click within each decision meter to edit. Remember to click Save if you want the values to remain!

For illustrative purposes, the Medication Management Decisions window is used as an example below to orient you to general Decisions pop-up window features.

**Note: Only administrators and the internal team have access to these functions.** Field users can upload their data file(s) from their team's Home page (as well as administrators and the internal team). Field users should refer to the [Dynamic Decision Dashboard section](#dynamic-decision-dashboard).

- Administrators can upload team data files and assign that file(s) to team(s) of their choice. 

**Please note these specifics about the behavior of team data files:**

- When a team data file is uploaded into a _shared or _team world, it will be available in all worlds (_ind, _team, and _shared) for all users of those worlds.
- When a team data file is uploaded to an _ind world, it is accessible exclusively to the _ind world only.
- When a team data file is deleted in a _shared or _team world, they are deleting it from _shared and _team worlds for all users of those worlds. This will _not_ impact _ind worlds.
- When a team data file is deleted in an _ind world, it will be removed from the _ind world exclusively.

#### Upload a New Team Data File to a Team

1. From the Administrator Dashboard, click Settings.

<img alt="Image of highlighted Settings button within the Administrator Dashboard." src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/mtl/gh-pages/images/admin_dashboard_settings.png">

### Forio Epicenter

Forio Epicenter is an enterprise platform that hosts our Sim UI and runs the simulations for end users. While the Sim UI can manage most administrator-user needs within the web interface, sometimes it is necessary to go directly into Epicenter to, for example, set up a new end user in Epicenter. Click [Epicenter](https://forio.com/epicenter/sign-in) to go to the login.

#### Send Password Reset to End User or Change Password

1. Log into [Epicenter](https://forio.com/epicenter/sign-in).
2. Click on Veterans Affairs.

<img alt="Image of the Forio Epicenter dashboard with Veterans Affairs group highlighted." src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/mtl/gh-pages/images/navigate_to_vet_affairs_project.png">

3. Click the End Users tab in the side navigation bar. 

<img alt="Image of highlighted Forio End Users tab." src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/mtl/gh-pages/images/select_end_user.png">

4. Use the search bar to search for a specific user.

<img alt="Image of highlighted search bar." src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/mtl/gh-pages/images/search_end_user.png">

5. To the right of the selected user's name, click the Edit button dropdown.
- Click Send Reset Password Link if you want to send a password reset.
- Click Change Password to change the password directly for the user.

<img alt="Image of end user edit dropdown, with password reset options highlighted." src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/mtl/gh-pages/images/forio_enduser_password.png">

#### Setup a New Epicenter End User

1. Navigate to a project.

**Note:** You would navigate to various projects to set up end users in different instances of the Sim UI.  For example, you would navigate to VA Sim UI-TEST-Slow to set an end-user up in the TEST environment.

<img alt="Image of VA Projects page within Forio with PROD project highlighted." src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/mtl/gh-pages/images/select_prod_project.png">

2. Navigate to Group page.

In the Epicenter hierarchy, "groups" are the highest entity.  Underneath groups are worlds.  In TeamPSD, we refer to groups as "teams."  Typically, we auto-setup a \_team group and a \_ind group to manage team assignments and individual worlds.

<img alt="Image of the Groups tab highlighted in the right-hand navigation area." src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/mtl/gh-pages/images/click_groups.png">

3. Select the desired Group.

<img alt="Image of a desired group highlighted." src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/mtl/gh-pages/images/select_desired_group.png">

4. Click the Add End Users button.

<img alt="Image of the Add End Users button highlighted." src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/mtl/gh-pages/images/add_end_users.png">

5. Add user email to field and click "Add/Invite User" button.

We usually put the user's VA email address in this field.  However, it does not have to be an email unless you are sending a notice via email to the user. Sometimes users just need an alias besides their email address.

<img alt="Image of the Add End Users page with fields to complete highlighted." src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/mtl/gh-pages/images/add_invite_user.png">

#### Setup a Team

**We don't set up teams directly in Epicenter anymore,** because there are multiple dependencies in the Sim UI that would be bypassed. See [Manage Teams](#manage-teams) for more information about setting up a team from the Administrator Dashboard. 

#### Setup an Admin

To set up an Admin, the end-user id must be assigned to the administrator_login group on the group's page.

<img alt="Image of the administrator_login group highlighted." src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/mtl/gh-pages/images/admin_end_user.png">
