## Set Up a Team

This section describes how a facilitator can set up a team manually, or use a Customer Management System (CMS) export to set up a team. **Team setup normally occurs by the end of _MTL_ Session 2, so the learners can access mtl.how/menu.**

### Manual Setup

1. Click the "Add" button. A Team Setup popup will appear.  **The Team Setup will not list all teams in Epicenter. It will only list teams assigned to the facilitator.**
<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/gh-pages/images/team_setup_overview.png?raw=true">

2. Add the team name.  Just add the teams' root name. The setup function will add "team" and "ind" extensions in Epicenter.
3. Type the teams' vision statement.
4. Select the Research Arm.
5. Click "Add" button to add a team member. A Add Team Members popup will appear. **Facilitators do not need to register with the team, because the system will automatically assign based on the login. However, a co-facilitator would have to be listed and assigned to the facilitator role.**

<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/gh-pages/images/add_team_pop_up.png?raw=true">

6. Enter First Name, Last Name, Email and Clinical Role information.
7. Use the Select Role to select team members' role on the team.
8. Click "Add" button.
9. Click the checkbox next to a name and "Edit" or "Delete" to update information or delete a team member.
10. Click "Done" button when finished.

<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/gh-pages/images/add_team_member_popup.png?raw=true">

## Review tt Menu Results

If you are a Facilitator, use your login to access the facilitator tools to access multiple team’s menu results. The system knows you are a facilitator based on your user id and will present the facilitator popup. From the popup, you can review the results of multiple teams.

1. Navigate to mtl.how/menu.

<image src = "https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/gh-pages/images/menu_url.png?raw=true">

## Set up a Facilitator Individual Team (_ind)

- Facilitators can go into any team session where they are listed as a facilitator.
- The Sim UI uses that listing to build the Select Team dropdown in the Facilitator Dashboard.
- A Facilitator cannot be assigned a world using the same alias, so a workaround is needed.
- The procedure below will explain how to use an additional alias to create and access a personal individual team.
- After following the procedure, your individual \_ind will be on your dropdown list.

<image src = "https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/gh-pages/images/nav_to_team_setup.png?raw=true">

1. Navigate to Team Setup

<image src = "https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/gh-pages/images/select_ind_team.png?raw=true">

2. Select desired \_ind\_team from Team Setup listing and click Edit.

<image src = "https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/gh-pages/images/add_ind.png?raw=true">

3. In the Edit Team Setup popup click Add.

<image src = "https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/gh-pages/images/enter_ind_alias.png?raw=true">

4. In the Add Team Members popup, enter your first name, last name, select Team Lead in Select Role dropdown, enter your name (example: James Rollins) again in the Enter Email field and enter your Clinical Role.  Click Add, then Done.  Your name is now your alternate alias to be used for _ind teams.

5. Be sure to note the alias under the Email column, this will appear in the Team dropdown in the Facilitator Dashboard.

 ## Download Team Data and Name File for Import to Sim UI

- A facilitator must follow certain naming conventions, which are explained below, when downloading Team Data files.
- When a Team Data file is downloaded from the Data UI, it is in a specific format that the Sim UI **reformats during upload.** This means that if a Team Data file is downloaded from the Sim UI and then re-uploaded to the Sim UI **it will not work!**
- The facilitator will be able assign the Team Data file to various teams and worlds of their choice from the Facilitator Dashboard in the Sim UI. See next section.

1. Type [mtl.how/data](mtl.how/data) into your Chrome, Edge, Safari or Firefox browser.

 <image src = "https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/gh-pages/images/mtl_data_nav.png?raw=true">

2. Navigate to the desired Region and VISN.

 <image src = "https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/gh-pages/images/mtl_data_visn_nav.png?raw=true">

3. Select and apply clinical and/or team flow data.

 <image src = "https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/gh-pages/images/mtl_data_select_data.png?raw=true">

4. In left-hand navigation, scroll down to "Team Data for SimUI" and click.

 <image src = "https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/gh-pages/images/mtl_data_export_team_data_2.png?raw=true">
 
6. The Team Data file is exported to your browser's download location. Open file location and rename file using the convention "Sta3n-number_geo-location_clinic_year_month_day."

 <image src = "https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/gh-pages/images/mtl_data_file_name.png?raw=true">

7. Upload data into Sim UI.

## Manage Team Data

1. In the Facilitator Dashboard, click on Team Setup in the middle right-hand side of the dashboard.

<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/gh-pages/images/nav_to_team_setup.png?raw=true">
