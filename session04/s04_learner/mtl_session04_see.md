## Learning Objectives

1. Describe the high priority needs reported across the team.
2. Test out how these needs are experienced across the team through team dialogue.
3. Consider the team vision and apply team decision-making to select a high-priority module of *MTL*.

# In-session Exercise (30 minutes)

1. Complete the [*MTL* Menu](https://mtl.how/menu) on your own.

2. Review the team's results in your team. 
- What stands out to you?

3. Look for areas of consensus among the team. 
- What does the team agree about?

4. Discuss items in which team members varied a lot in their rankings. 
- Where does the team have more variable perspectives?

5. Focus on the high priority needs to select a module for sessions 5-10 of *Modeling to Learn*
What is the highest priority need for your team now?

These are the *MTL* available modules
- Care Coordination (CC)
- Medication Management (MM)
- Psychotherapy (PSY)
- Aggregrate team services (AGG)
- Measurement-based stepped care for suicide prevention (SP)
