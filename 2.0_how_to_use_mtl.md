I'm Lindsey, and this is Debbie. How can we get more Veterans better without adding hours in our day? To get Veterans better, we have to account for the number of hours available in the day. Yet because we don't have the right information about how we manage our time, we can pursue unrealistic treatment plans or improvement strategies that violate the laws of physics. _Modeling to Learn_ encourages us to account for clinician time differently, to make our plans feasible locally. Most VA data systems offer snapshots of cross-sectional data, but this kind of information doesn't help us account for the dynamics of evidence-based care over time. While many VA data systems are available, most display either quarterly lags from a high-level view or an in the weeds patient by patient view. _Modeling to Learn_ helps to bridge these two views. _Modeling to Learn_ introduces trends over time based on the clinic selections carefully reviewed by the staff on site. Trends help us zoom out to understand how we're doing for most of the Veterans we serve. _Modeling to Learn_ also introduces time-based definitions of care in the units of patients per week, appointments per week, or episodes of care per week. We use a week because over the last several years clinicians told us this is how they think in the clinic. There often is no typical day and a lot has happened by the end of a month. Defining care by week is more beneficial. High quality care in the clinic is always constrained by the available staffing capacity and the hours in the day to see patients, the number of weeks between visits, and the weeks of engagement over time. But do you have time to run these equations in your head or calculate them from the other dashboards you use? As an alternative, _Modeling to Learn_ puts these components of care together to understand their interdependence over time. How can _Modeling to Learn_ consultation help?

Hi, I'm Lindsey and this is David. How does _Modeling to Learn_ benefit substance use disorder, or SUD programs? When _Modeling to Learn_ began almost 10 years ago, as a partnership among patients, providers and policy makers across VA, we worked iteratively to define the dynamics of common care problems for the primary reasons Veterans seek addiction and mental health care. We found that if we focused on improving timely, high-quality evidence-based psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy for alcohol use disorder, depression, opioid use disorder and PTSD, we could support VA staff in meeting around 80% of Veterans needs for behavioral healthcare. We work with frontline teams and partners from the VA Academic Detailing Program and the Psychotropic Drug Safety Initiative or PDSI and developed the Medication Management Module of _Modeling to Learn_. This module helps manage the dynamics of evidence-based pharmacotherapies for alcohol use disorder and opioid use disorder based on their effectiveness in reducing craving, relapse, and overdose. You can find the Medication Management module in _Modeling to Learn_  data [mtl.how/data](mtl.how/data) and Simulation User Interface [mtl.how/sim](mtl.how/sim). The _Modeling to Learn_  Medication Management module supports improvement in the AlcTop or Alcohol Topiramate indicator from the Mental Health Information System or MIS and the SUD 16 indicator from the Strategic Analytics for Improvement in Learning or SAIL. How does _Modeling to Learn_  help? Prescribers describe the need to better visualize how to locally optimize their medication management appointment supply, including top of license care from staff with and without a Drug Enforcement Agency X-waiver for OUD medication. _Modeling to Learn_  helps a team assess this appointment supply, new patient start rate, no show or missed appointment rate, and the clinically appropriate return-to-clinic visit interval needed for a therapeutic response to alcohol use disorder and opioid use disorder medications. The Medication Management module helps teams and sites find the optimal number of patients who can be engaged in AUD and OUD therapies over time and helps them distinguish the flow of their patients who require antidepressants or other medication needs. Given that community needs and team staffing is dynamic and can change over time, these resources can empower teams to find local improvements that otherwise may be hard to find. Another common module for addressing Veterans SUD needs for group and other therapies is the Team Care module, which helps teams assess and optimize their overall mix of local multidisciplinary services as a function of staffing and patient needs. We are evaluating how _Modeling to Learn_  improves Veterans who start and complete a therapeutic course of medication for AUD and OUD with research funding from the VA and the National Institute on Drug Abuse or NIDA. What about other common SUD comorbidities and presenting concerns? For example, how does _Modeling to Learn_  benefit PTSD, clinical teams or PCTs? Watch that video to find out.
 
## How does _Modeling to Learn_ benefit PTSD Clinical Teams or PCTs?

Hi, I'm Lindsey and this is Debbie. How does _Modeling to Learn_ benefit PTSD clinical teams, or PCTs? Since I'm at the National Center for PTSD, this priority is very close to my heart. When _Modeling to Learn_ began almost 10 years ago as a partnership among patients, providers and policy makers across VA, we worked iteratively to define the dynamics of common care problems for the primary reasons Veterans seek addiction and mental health care. We found that if we focused on improving timely, high-quality evidence-based psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy for alcohol use disorder, depression, opioid use disorder and PTSD, we could support VA staff in meeting around 80% of Veterans needs for behavioral healthcare. _Modeling to Learn_ helps teams better evaluate the local dynamics of balancing the needs of new and existing patients for evidence-based psychotherapies, particularly cognitive processing therapy and prolonged exposure. Teams described the challenges of starting new patients who had never had their needs met without compromising care for Veterans already engaged in therapy. _Modeling to Learn_ enables teams to see where their Veterans get stuck, to decide when to graduate patients, or to recognize when the weeks between return to clinic visits start to get too long. Have you been trying to improve PTSD 56 in the Strategic Analytics for Improvement and Learning, or SAIL? We worked with local PTSD clinical teams from the beginning and have supported many more teams over the years who have engaged with the evidence-based psychotherapy programs or the PTSD mentorship program to meet these needs. The psychotherapy module of the _Modeling to Learn_ data user interface, and simulation user interface helps teams to see how they're doing for patients who are starting psychotherapy, how many flow through to complete a therapeutic dose, and whether Veterans are getting near weekly therapy consistent with the PTSD treatment evidence base. There's also the ability to assess emerging approaches such as masked or intensive outpatient psychotherapy and other scenarios that are commonly considered and implemented in PCTs. You may also be wondering about the flow from primary care or from primary care mental health integration, or PCMHI, teams into general mental health and specialty mental health programs like PCTs. Stepped care up and down the mental health continuum of care can also be optimized to local needs using the _Modeling to Learn_ Team Flow module. Speaking of the care continuum, you may be wondering how does _Modeling to Learn_ benefit Behavioral Health Integration program or BHIP teams? Watch that video to find out.

## How does _Modeling to Learn_ benefit Behavioral Health Integration Program or BHIP teams?

Hi, I'm Lindsey and this is David. How does modeling to learn benefit Behavioral Health Integration Program or BHIP teams? What are the challenges with providing excellent team care? One challenge is the data sources to support team decision making jump from the individual patient and clinician counter all the way to the entire clinic or facility. It can mean that teams are flying blind to how they're coordinating care for their Veterans. This can be especially hard when teams are short staffed or when staff, patient needs, and local policies continually change. It's hard to know what improvements you might be able to find in your own team for coordinating evidence-based psychotherapies and pharmacotherapies over time. One way that _Modeling to Learn_ can complement other BHIP resources is through the Data User Interface available at [mtl.how/data](mtl.how/data). The Clinic Selection and Team Flow Selection tabs empower teams to carefully review the clinics that comprise their data views. Data are never all good or all bad. _Modeling to Learn_ emphasizes transparency. Teams need to know what data they're getting and its strengths and weaknesses for guiding a particular decision. The Clinic Selection tabs update every day to reflect all the Mental Health 500 series Stop Code, Clinic, or Grid updates that may be going on locally. Teams can save bookmarks that reflect their specific clinic selections, for example to include trainees or to select any of the clinics they have used within the last two years. This can be helpful when new BHIP teams are being formed or remapped. The team Patient Data tabs update daily too, so teams can view the patient diagnosis, encounter, health factor, measurement-based care, and high-risk flag information all in one place, and then the team can zoom out to filter and view these data as team trends. Coordinating care within a team is challenging. No single clinician can offer all the services a Veteran may need, so treatment plans must be coordinated in real time, over time, to support Veteran improvement. Clinicians may not have visibility on exactly how appointment supplies divvied up into intake evaluations, individual and group psychotherapy, medication management, or other adjunctive supportive therapies. What is particularly important about the _Modeling to Learn_ simulation user interface at [mtl.how/sim](mtl.how/sim) is the ability to assess not only the appointment supply, but even more important, the service proportions of patients that flow through to these services after intake or treatment plan review. One of the most common scenarios teams assess is how to respond to patient needs when they may not have the perfect staffing mix. Even when you know patient flow through care is divvied up into a mix of services, the dynamics over time are too much to understand in your head. The _Modeling to Learn_ simulation user interface enables teams to quickly assess the dynamics of available appointment supply, service proportions, and the other two major factors that govern patient improvement, the return-to-clinic visit interval in weeks and the overall duration in care. We've often used _Modeling to Learn_ to help teams find a way to ensure evidence-based care through the decisions that they make all day and find improvements in quality of care and quality of work life that they didn't think was possible due to limited staffing. You might wonder, how does _Modeling to Learn_ support stepped care up to BHIP from primary care or primary care mental health integration, or from general mental health up or down into specialty mental health programs such as substance use disorder programs or PTSD clinical teams?
