## Learning Objectives

1. Describe what your team has prioritized as decisions to implement in your clinic.
2. Test your team's plan against your individual and shared team vision.
3. Apply your team's plan in clinical decisions using C.F.B.T. systems thinking.

## In-session Exercise (30 minutes)

### Connect learning and decisions from experiments to original team vision, question, and need.

1. What shared vision did the team decide on in session 1?  

2. What team need and questions did we identify?  

3. What hypotheses did we test?  

4. What insights will we keep in mind as we make clinic decisions?  

5. What new approaches or targets do we want to focus on?  

6. What concrete actions can the team take in the real world?  

7. How do these decisions align with the team's shared vision, question and needs?  

8. What data will we watch to see how we're doing?
