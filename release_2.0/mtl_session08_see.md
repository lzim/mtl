# MTL Live Session 08

## Today we're modeling to learn how to test a dynamic hypothesis.

## Learning Objectives

1. Describe the systems story your team believes will cause the outcomes you expect to observe in your experiment.

2. Test your dynamic hypothesis about your team's clinical priority.

3. Apply systems thinking to describe your team's findings, insights, and conclusions from your experiment.

## In-session Exercise (30 minutes)

### Running an Experiment

1. Log in to your individual or team world at mtl.how/sim_test.  

    [![sim ui screen cast](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/gifs/mtl_2.0/sim_ui_1.gif)](#.)  

    **_MTL_ 2.0. For _MTL_ 1.7, click [here](https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/master/release_1.7/mtl_session08_see.md)**  

2. If you logged into your *individual world*, review your saved runs in the Experiment Maintenance section. Rename your saved runs if you feel you need to.  

3. If you logged into your *individual world*, review the data files you have uploaded in the Team Data Menu Maintenance section and make sure you have the data file you want.  

4. You can *Join Current Session* or *Start a New Session* in any module. If you *Start a New Session* select the team data file you’d like to use.  

    - Once you have logged in to the model, the Text box will appear on the right. You can move, "x out" of or expand the Text box at any time.  

5. To refresh your memory and pick up where you left off last time, select the experiment from the last session and check the box to include text from this session in Expanded Outputs text fields. Review those text fields.

    **_MTL_ 2.0. For _MTL_ 1.7, click [here](https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/master/release_1.7/mtl_session08_see.md)**  

6. Study the system diagram and team data, and decide together what change you want to experiment with, that might give the team the desired result.  

7. To create a new run building off of the previous one, revise the text in all the text boxes to reflect the experiment you want to do now:  

    [<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_question.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/>](#.) **Our Question.** *Briefly describe what your team wants to learn from this experiment.*  

    [<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_hypothesis.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/>](#.) **Our Hypothesis.** *Outline the systems story your team believes will cause the outcomes your team expects to observe.*  

8. Adjust experiment sliders for the new experiment, keeping in mind that the previous run’s settings are in effect (for this session that just means the base case or default values).

9. Run and then Save (without resetting). Name this run according to the variable setting(s) you changed.

10. Compare Experiments to see the difference the between base case and the current experimental run.

    Record what you learned:  

    [<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_findings.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/>](#.) **Our Findings.** *Describe your team's findings, insights and conclusions from this experiment.*  

11. Discuss and record what changes you may want to make in the clinic and what further experiments you want to run.  

    [<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_decisions.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/>](#.) **Our Decisions.** *Based on what you learned in this experiment, what changes are you ready to make in your practice?*  

12. Save and Reset when ready.
