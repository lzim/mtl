### Session 09 Say Checklist

**Today we're modeling to learn how to compare alternatives.**  

Hello! I'm __________ and I'm __________ [Co-facilitators introduce themselves]. Today we're modeling to learn how to compare alternatives.

- [ ] [<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/done.png" height = "40" width = "40">](#DontClick)  **Done:** We explored the base case (bc) and experiment 1 and drafted a dynamic hypothesis to prepare for experiment 2.
- [ ] [<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/do.png" height = "45" width = "45">](#DontClick) **Do:** We will run experiment 2 to compare alternatives.

**Learning Objectives for Session 9**

1. Describe the systems story your team believes will cause the outcomes you expect to observe in your experiment.

2. Test your dynamic hypothesis about your team's clinical priority.

3. Apply systems thinking to describe your team's findings, insights and conclusions from your experiment.

- [ ] Join current session to pick up where the team left off in Session 08.
- [ ] On **Main Page** team lead navigate to **Experiment Section** to **pull up previous experiment values & text** for **Sessions 07 and 08** to review Experiment 1 as compared to the base case.

**Pull up q/h/f/d from session08 and ask team lead to review the rationale for the Experiment 1 findings from the "Findings" Text**

- [ ] [<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/illustrations/data_ui_sim_ui.png" height = "50" width = "150">](#DontClick) Provide rationale for **always comparing simulation experiments against the base case** of no new decisions.
- [ ] Review the **"d" decisions text** regarding the **team consensus** about **specific values** _______________ the team would like to experiment with today.    
**Bring session 08 "d" _decision_ text to be the _question_ text for experiment 2. Collapse and move Text to right, to use session 07 and session 08 _causal complexity reveal (feedback loop)_ to revise _base case_ hypothesis for experiment 2.**

**Specific Variables and Values from Priority Causal Loop**_______________

- [ ] Use the **causal system story** in the **model diagram complexity reveal for the team's priority** to "stake a claim" about what will happen over the next two years - _relative to the base case and Experiment 1_ - if the **team's decisions reflect experiment 2** 
- [ ] Example question: "What happens to ____________ [**key output value from the team's priority**], over the next two years if our team **practice decisions follow __________________[experiment 2]**?"

**Move Text to left and refine/enter _specific values_ for experiment 2 in *hypothesis text* as you adjust sliders**

- [ ] Example **experiment 2 hypothesis,** using specific **variables** and **values**: "Relative to the base case and Experiment 1, if we **reduce the engagement duration** to 12 or 14 weeks in our team, then due to the **Feedback Loop: Balancing New and Existing Patients,** over the next two years, we will ___________." 
- [ ] Set all other **red** and **green** **experiment sliders** to **"bc" or "zero"** except **purple sensitivity sliders**, which start with a default middle value of **"1"**.

**Run experiment 2**

- [ ] Hit the **Green Run Button**!
- [ ] Go to the **Expanded Outputs** section and **Save** (without resetting) our run. 

**Compare experiment 2 against base case and experiment 1 output charts of the _specific variables_ and _values_ related to the team's highest priority need ________________[output variable]**

- [ ] Enter team **findings text** about the results for **variables related to their highest priority need**? 
- [ ] Describe how **Differences between base case and experiment 1 and 2 System Behavior** findings are explained by **Causal Loop Complexity Reveal** for team's priority in the *Our Findings* textbox
- [ ] **Decisions:** Based on what the team learned, what will the team **decide to do in clinical practice** (if anything) and/or:
- [ ] **Decisions:** What **specific variables** at **what specific experiment values**  will the team use _Modeling to Learn_ to learn next?

**Have Team Lead pull up the session 09 SEE guide Done/Do review.**

- [ ] Done: We **ran experiment 2** and **compared results against the bc and experiment 1,** and entered our Question, Hypothesis, Findings and Decision for Experiment 2 in the Text section.
- [ ] Do: Log into mtl.how/sim and **prepare for experiment 3,** by **entering q/h/f/d text** and running an **Experiment 3 that combines Experiments 1 and 2.**
- [ ] Demo for team how to **reload team Question, Hypothesis, Findings and Decision text into Individual World.** 
- [ ] Reminder to click "Save" and log out.
