# _MTL_ Red Part 2

## Today we're _modeling to learn_ how to produce team data.

## Learning Objectives

1. Describe your team trends over the last two years based on the estimates in the team data.

2. Test your understanding of how the team data are estimated by reviewing descriptions and definitions.

3. Apply your clinical expertise to consider the team trends in the viz and data tabs and team data to identify team priorities for learning.

## In-session Exercise (40 minutes)

### Last session, we made Clinic Selections to _zoom in_ on a particular Veteran's care in the data tabs and to _zoom out_ and see what our care decisions are adding up to over time by reviewing team trends over the last two years in the viz tabs. 

### Today, we use Clinic Selections to review team data estimates related to common care problems.

- **Team Data are means, medians and percentages of key variables likely to influence the team's priorities for learning from *Modeling to Learn,* each stored in their own _Modeling to Learn_ tabs**:
  - **Care Coordination (CC)**
  - **Medication Management (MM)**
  - **Psychotherapy (PSY)**
  - **Team (AGG) Care**
  - **Team (SP) Flow: Measurement Based Stepped Care and Suicide Prevention** 
 
### Produce tabs of descriptive team data:
- At [mtl.how/data](https://mtl.how/data), select your consortium and VISN on the Data UI Landing page. 
- Click on the "Clinic Selection" and "Team Flow Selection" tab.
- Your Team's Clinic Selections and Team Flow Selections from the previous session should auto-populate in these tabs.
     - If not, you can select the same set of clinics you chose in Part 1 of _Modeling to Learn_ Red.
     - Click "Apply".

**_MTL_ 3.0.**
**For _MTL_ 2.0, click [here.](https://github.com/lijenn/mtl/blob/master/blue/session02/s02_learner/mtl_session02_see.md)**

### 1. Select a module for review

- **Find a variable that is important to your team. How is it estimated in this module? What are its units?**
- **Where can you find even more detailed information about your team data?**
- **Check out the "Descriptions" Tab and the "Details" Tab corresponding to this module. What is the difference between the "Descriptions" and "Details" tabs?**

### 2. Select a second module for review

- **Check out the "Descriptions" Tab and the "Details" Tab corresponding to this module. What is the difference between the "Descriptions" and "Details" tabs?**
- **Find a variable that is important to your team. How is it estimated in this module? What are its units?**
- **Where can you find even more detailed information about your team data?**

### 3. Are there any team data values you would like to explore in the viz and data tabs?

- **If so, which ones? Navigate to the viz and data tabs to examine your question.**

### 4. Does the team see any values in the team data that seem to vary significantly from expectations?

- **If so, what is surprising? Does the estimation definition (in "Descriptions" tab) help you to interpret the variable value?** 

### 5. Does the team see any values in the team data that fit your expectations about high priority team needs?

- **If so, what are you noticing? In what ways does the team data fit with your day-to-day clinical practice in your team?**
