## Learning Objectives

1. Describe your team trends over the last two years based on the estimates in the team data.

2. Test your understanding of how the team data are estimated by reviewing descriptions and definitions.

3. Apply your clinical expertise to consider the team trends in the data UI and team data to identify team priorities for learning.

## In-session Exercise (30 minutes)

### When you make Clinic Selections & click the "Apply" button, it produces tabs of descriptive team data.

- Data are means, medians and percentages of key variables likely to influence the team's priorities for learning from *Modeling to Learn.*
- There are team data produced for each module of *Modeling to Learn.*
  - Care Coordination (CC)
  - Medication Management (MM)
  - Psychotherapy (PSY)
  - Team (AGG) Care
  - Measurement-based stepped care and suicide prevention (SP)
 
- On the Data UI Landing page, Click on "Data UI (Team Data)." 
- Click on the  **ClinicSelection tab**. 
- We have already saved the Clinic Selections you made last time in your team's **Report Bookmark.** You can find your Team Report Bookmark by clicking on the **Bookmark** icon at the top right of your screen and finding the bookmark with your Team Name.
- To make clinic selections yourself, you can select the same set of clinics selections you made for the Data & Viz tabs to review team data estimates to the related common care problems mentioned above.

- *Coming Soon!* If you want to produce data for the **SP module**, click on the **SPReferrals tab**. Use this tab to select clinics that your team refers to/receives referrals from for the Measurement Based Stepped Care and Suicide Prevention module. The data pull will track patients stepped up/down between your team and the one(s) you select. For example, if you are a GMH team, you would select "SMH" in the dropdown for "The clinics selected below that my team refers to are" and add the SMH clinics your team refers to in Column A. Once you have selected referral clinics in the **SPReferrals tab**, return to the "ClinicSelection" tab.
- *Coming Soon!* If you include SP in the module selection, three pop-ups will appear for the three possible care settings (GMH, SMH, PC/PCMHI) to indicate the threshold for minimum gap in patient care required for subsequent visit to be considered a new care episode. *In general for the (GMH or SMH or PC/PCMHI) setting, how long of a gap in patient care is required for the subsequent visit to be considered a new care episode? Set the threshold below in weeks. The default threshold is 39 weeks (9 months).*

### 1. Select a module for review

- Find a variable that is important to your team. How is it estimated in this module? What are its units?
- Where can you find even more detailed information about your team data?
- Check out the "Descriptions" Tab and the "Details" Tab corresponding to this module. What is the difference between the "Descriptions" and "Details" tabs?

### 2. Select a second module for review

- Check out the "Descriptions" Tab and the "Details" Tab corresponding to this module. What is the difference between the "Descriptions" and "Details" tabs?
- Find a variable that is important to your team. How is it estimated in this module? What are its units?
- Where can you find even more detailed information about your team data?

### 3. Are there any team data table values you would like to explore in the team data UI?

- If so, which ones? Open the data UI to examine your question.

### 4. Does the team see any values in the team data that seem to vary significantly from expectations?

- If so, what is surprising? Does the estimation definition (text in red) help you to interpret the variable value?

### 5. Does the team see any values in the team data that fit your expectations about high priority team needs?

- If so, what are you noticing? In what ways does the team data fit with your day-to-day clinical practice in your team?
