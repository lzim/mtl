# [MTL Red Part II Facilitator Checklist](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/mtl_facilitate_workgroup/mtl_live_guide/mtl_live_session03_see.Rmd "MTL Live Session 03")

# Today we're modeling to learn how to produce team data.  
- [ ] Hello! I'm __________ and I'm __________ [Co-facilitators introduce themselves]. Today we're modeling to learn how to produce team data.

### Navigate to the SEE guide to show Done/Do table
[<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style = “display:inline-block”/>](#DontClick) ____________ **Time 00:00-00:10 - Done/Do and Learning Objectives**
 
- [ ] [<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/done.png" height = "40" width = "40">](#DontClick) Done: We reviewed the HF, Diag, Enc andTeam (SP) Flowtabs in your team data to find a patient and a team trend. We opened mtl.how/data_test in a browser and looked at the two team folders: data UI and team data table.  
- [ ] [<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/do.png" height = "40" width = "40">](#DontClick) 
Do: We will produce a team data table for the _MTL_ simulation user-interface (sim UI).


<!-- Learning Objectives Icon --> 
[<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/learning_objectives.png" height = "45" width = "45">](DontClick)  
## Learning Objectives for Part II
1. Describe your team trends over the last two years based on the estimates in the team data.
2. Test out your understanding of how the team data is estimated through review of the descriptions and definitions. 
3. Apply your clinical expertise to consider the team trends in the data UI and team data to identify team priorities for learning.

## Start In-session Exercise
[<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style = “display:inline-block”/>](#DontClick) ____________ **Time 00:10-00:15 – Review Graphic & Navigate to mtl.how/data_test**
- [ ] We will use the data UI to look back at team trends over the past two years - *what is*;   


<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/illustrations/data_ui_sim_ui.png">


### 1. Navigate to the data UI at mtl.how/data_test. 
- [ ] Data UI on VA's secure Power BI site; works on any browser.
- [ ] You must have your PIV card engaged and you should have all the same permissions to access the site. 
- [ ] On the Data UI Landing page, click on "Data UI (Team Data)." 

[<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style = “display:inline-block”/>](#DontClick) ____________ **Time 00:15-00:25 – Review how to “Get Team Data Table"**

### 2. When you make Clinic Selections & click the "Apply" button, it produces tabs of descriptive team data.
#### IMPORTANT: We already have a "Report Bookmark" saved with the Clinic Selections your team made last session. Click on the "Bookmark" icon and select your Team Name to locate it.
- [ ] Data in the "Team Data" tab are means, medians and percentages of key variables likely to influence the team's priorities for learning from *Modeling to Learn*. 
- [ ] There are team data produced for each module of *Modeling to Learn*, each stored in its own tab:
   + Care Coordination (CC) - tab title *Care Coordination (CC)*
   + Medication Management (MM) - tab title *Medication Management (MM)*
   + Psychotherapy (PSY) - tab title *Psychotherapy (PSY)*
   + Team (Aggregate) Care - tab title * Team (AGG) Care*
   + *Coming Soon!* Team (SP) Flow: Measurement Based Stepped Care and Suicide Prevention - tab title *SPParams*

*- [ ] Your Clinic Selections are already saved for you, but to do it for yourself:*  
    -- [ ] Select a set of clinics in **ClinicSelection tab**.  
    -- [ ] Click "Apply."
    
### *Coming Soon* See SAY guide for narration details on generating file forTeam (SP) Flowmodule  
 
 [<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style = “display:inline-block”/>](#DontClick) ____________ **Time 00:25-00:35 – Select and review a *MTL* Module**

### 3. Let's select a module for review - to show what data are used to tailor each *MTL* module to your team.  

#### [Choose a module] – *See SAY guide for descriptions of each module*  

- [ ] Check out the different modules that are highlighted in the team data on the screen. As we review, we will use the mouse to highlight key team data variables.  
- [ ] Find a variable important to your team. Look at how it is estimated in the tab and notice the units.  
- [ ] The Team Data tabs have more detailed information about team data.  
- [ ] Review  the "Descriptions" and "Details" tabs below the tab with the numerical data [show with mouse]:  
	-- The "Descriptions" Tab [click on Tab] gives the description or definition of the variable.  
	-- The "Details" Tab [click on Tab] contains additional details about how individual patient data are extracted and used to calculate your team’s historical trends. 
	
[<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style = “display:inline-block”/>](#DontClick) ____________ **Time 00:35-00:45 – Select and review a second *MTL* Module**  

### 4. Let’s select a second module for review.  
- [ ] Again, check out the"Descriptions" and "Details" tabs below the tab with the numerical data. 
- [ ] Find a variable important to the team. How is it estimated in this tab? What are its units?   
- [ ] Where can you find even more detailed information about your team data? Click on the “DataNotes” tab for a breakdown of how the patient cohort is defined, CPT codes used, and patient engagement patterns (Psychotherapy module).  

[<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style = “display:inline-block”/>](#DontClick) ____________ **Time 00:45-00:50 – Explore team data table values of interest to the team**  

### 5. Are there any team data values you would like to explore in the team data UI?  
### 6. Do you see any team data values that differ a lot from what you would expect?  
### 7. Do you see any team data values that confirm your thoughts about high priority team needs?  
- [ ] What are you noticing? What is surprising?
- [ ] In what ways does the team data fit with your day-to-day experience?  

### That's it for _Modeling to learn_ how to produce team data for simulation. Next is our Done/Do review.

### Navigate to the SEE guide to show Done/Do table  
[<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style = “display:inline-block”/>](#DontClick) ____________ **Time 00:50-01:00 – Done / Do Review**  

 
- [ ] [<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/done.png" height = "40" width = "40">](#DontClick) Done: We produced team data for the _MTL_ simulation user-interface (sim UI).  
- [ ] [<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/do.png" height = "40" width = "40">](#DontClick) Do: Find something in the team data table. Complete the mtl.how/menu to prioritize your needs. Responses are confidential.  
### DO demo
-	Encourage team members to look around in the team data table before next time. 
-	Ask team members to fill out form at mtl.how/menu (open on Chrome or Edge for the best experience).
-	The username is yout VA email. It will take about 5 minutes. 
-	Responses will be aggregated and discussed in Session 4 to help choose which *MTL* module we'll use for the next several sessions of *Modeling to Learn*.

## Until next time, thank you for *Modeling to Learn*!
