# _MTL_ Red Part II Facilitator Checklist

# Today we're _modeling to learn_ how to produce team data. 

- [ ] Hello! I'm __________ and I'm __________ [Co-facilitators introduce themselves]. Today we're _modeling to learn_ how to produce team data.

### Navigate to the SEE guide to show Done/Do table
[<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style = “display:inline-block”/>](#DontClick) ____________ **Time 00:00-00:10 - Done/Do and Learning Objectives**
 
- [ ] [<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/done.png" height = "40" width = "40">](#DontClick) Done: We reviewed the HF, Diag, Enc, Meas, and Flag tabs in Viz and Data tabs to find a patient (zoom in) and find a team trend (zoom out). We logged in to mtl.how/data_test and looked at the team data.
- [ ] [<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/do.png" height = "40" width = "40">](#DontClick) 
Do: We will examine Team Data for CC, MM, PSY, Team (AGG) Care, and Team (SP) Flow.

## Learning Objectives for Part II

1. Describe your team trends over the last two years based on the estimates in the team data.
2. Test your understanding of how the team data are estimated by reviewing descriptions and definitions.
3. Apply your clinical expertise to consider the team trends in the viz and data tabs and team data to identify team priorities for learning.

## Start In-session Exercise
[<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style = “display:inline-block”/>](#DontClick) ____________ **Time 00:10-00:15 – Navigate to [mtl.how/data_test](https://mtl.how/data_test)**

- [ ] Who would like to "drive" today? [Recommend the Team Lead]

### Last session, we made Clinic Selections to _zoom in_ on a particular Veteran's care in the data tabs and to _zoom out_ and see what our care decisions are adding up to over time by reviewing team trends over the last two years in the viz tabs. 

### Today, we use Clinic Selections to review team data estimates related to common care problems.
- [ ] **Team Data tabs contain means, medians and percentages of key variables likely to influence the team's priorities for learning from _Modeling to Learn_.**
- [ ] **In today's session, we will use Clinic Selections to review Team Data estimates related to common care problems, each stored in their own  _Modeling to Learn_ tabs**:
   - **Care Coordination (CC)**
   - **Medication Management (MM)**
   - **Psychotherapy (PSY)**
   - **Team (Aggregate) Care**
   - **Team (Suicide Prevention) Flow: Measurement Based Stepped Care and Suicide Prevention**

[<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style = “display:inline-block”/>](#DontClick) ____________ **Time 00:15-00:20 – Review how to produce Team Data**

## Once we make Clinic Selections and Team Flow Selection and click the "Apply" button, we produce tabs of descriptive team data.

- [ ] At [mtl.how/data_test](https://mtl.how/data_test), select your consortium and VISN on the Data UI Landing page. 
- [ ] Click on the "Clinic Selection" and "Team Flow Selection" tab.
- [ ] Your Team's Clinic Selections and Team Flow Selections from the previous session should auto-populate in these tabs.
     - If not, you can select the same set of clinics you chose in Part 1 of _Modeling to Learn_ Red.
     - Click "Apply". 
 
 [<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style = “display:inline-block”/>](#DontClick) ____________ **Time 00:20-00:30 – Select and review a *MTL* Module**

### Let's select a module for review - to show what data are used to tailor each *MTL* module to your team.  

#### 1. [Choose a module] – *See SAY guide for descriptions of each module*  

- [ ] **Check out the different modules that are highlighted in the team data on the screen. As we review, we will use the mouse to highlight key team data variables.**  
- [ ] **Find a variable important to your team. Look at how it is estimated in the tab and notice the units.**
- [ ] **The "Descriptions" and "Details" tabs have more detailed information about team data.** 
- [ ] **Review  the "Descriptions" and "Details" tabs with the numerical data [show with mouse]:**
	- **The "Descriptions" Tab [click on Tab] gives the description or definition of the variable.**  
	- **The "Details" Tab [click on Tab] contains additional details about how individual patient data are extracted and used to calculate your team’s historical trends.**
	
[<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style = “display:inline-block”/>](#DontClick) ____________ **Time 00:30-00:40 – Select and review a second *MTL* Module**  

### 2. Let’s select a second module for review.  
- [ ] **Check out the "Descriptions" and "Details" tabs with the numerical data.**
- [ ] **Find a variable important to the team. How is it estimated in this tab? What are its units?** 
- [ ] **Where can you find even more detailed information about your team data?** 
- [ ] **Click on the “Data Notes 1” and "Data Notes 2" tab for a breakdown of how the patient cohort is defined, CPT codes used, and patient engagement patterns (for the Psychotherapy module).**

[<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style = “display:inline-block”/>](#DontClick) ____________ **Time 00:40-00:50 – Explore team data table values of interest to the team**  

### 3. Are there any team data values you would like to explore in the viz & data tabs?  
### 4. Do you see any team data values that differ a lot from what you would expect?  
### 5. Do you see any team data values that confirm your thoughts about high priority team needs?  
- [ ] **What are you noticing? What is surprising?**
- [ ] **In what ways does the team data fit with your day-to-day experience?**

### That's it for _Modeling to learn_ how to produce team data. Next is our Done/Do review.

### Navigate to the SEE guide to show Done/Do table  
[<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style = “display:inline-block”/>](#DontClick) ____________ **Time 00:50-0:60 – Done / Do Review**  

 
- [ ] [<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/done.png" height = "40" width = "40">](#DontClick) Done: We examined team data for CC, MM, PSY, Team (AGG) Care, and Team (SP) Flow.
- [ ] [<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/do.png" height = "40" width = "40">](#DontClick) Do: Find something in the team data and consider its implications for team decisions.

### DO demo
- [ ] Encourage team members to look around in the team data and test whether you can find a piece of data you decide to look for.
- [ ] Remind the team that they can click through the "Description" and "Details" tabs, one for each module, to dig into the definitions and details of how each team data is calculated.

## Until next time, thank you for *Modeling to Learn*!
