# MTL Red Part I Facilitator Checklist

## Today we're modeling to learn from patient data and team trends.

- [ ]  Hello! I'm __________ and I'm __________. Today we're modeling to learn how to check our patient data and team trends.
- [ ] Navigate to the Learner See Guide for Part I to show Done and Do.

### Navigate to the SEE guide to show Done/Do table  
- [ ] [<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/done.png" height = "40" width = "40">](#DontClick) Done: We set a standing team meeting time at __________. We logged in to mtl.how/data to look at the data UI.
- [ ] [<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/do.png" height = "40" width = "40">](#DontClick) We will select a Team Lead; We will select and review Team Data for _MTL_ relevant to our Team.

## Learning Objectives
1. Describe the decisions your team made in producing your team data.
2. Test whether team historical trends shown in the "viz" tabs reflect your expectations.
3. Apply your clinical expertise to identify new information about a team patient in the "data" tabs.

### Participatory Learning from Data

**_Modeling to Learn_** can help us to get more of our Veterans to the right care in the right time to meet their needs using participatory learning from data.

- [ ] We use the data user interface (UI) to look back at team trends over the past two years to see *what is* in our team now.
- [ ] Even when we see trends that we like, we may not know what is causing those trends. And, we may be afraid that the next change we might make will undo it.
- [ ] It is also really demotivating to see trends we don't like, and not know what is causing the problem.
- [ ] What we're doing today is *looking back* using the data UI.

## We **zoom in** on a particular **Veteran's care** in the **data** tabs, then we can **zoom out** see what our care decisions are adding up to over time by reviewing **team trends** over the last two years in the **viz** tabs. ##

- [ ] Confirm who will "drive" today [Recommend the Team Lead]

### 1. On any browser, navigate to mtl.how/data.
- [ ] Explain the _MTL_ data user interface Power BI site:
	- You must have your PIV engaged to access the site.
- *Reminder:* Power BI site contains Protected Health Information (PHI) - access is according to the permissions that are set up on your PIV.  
- We'll show you how to pull and view data here. It will be stored and saved back to the secure site, so that you can protect patient PHI just as you do in all your work.

- [ ] In the left-hand navigation, click one of the four consortia tabs to locate your VISN.
- [ ] Click on the "Clinic Selections" tab.

### 2. Select and View Your Local Team Data 

- [ ] **Think through your Clinic Selection criteria carefully (e.g. Should you include trainees? De-activated clinics? Clinical Resource Hub providers?).**
- Clinics and data not populating? Request and verify your local server views [described at the bottom of the See guide](https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/master/red/part1/part1_learner/mtl_red_part_1_see.md#request-and-verify-local-server-view-permissions).
- [ ] You can filter by "Division Name", "Physical Location", "Primary Stopcode", "Secondary Stopcode", and/or "Is an Active Clinic?" (de-activated clinics denoted by "ZZ") in the left and middle columns.
- [ ] You can search and filter for your team's clinics by clinic name or by provider in the "Select Clinics to Generate Report Data" column after making selections in the left and middle columns.
- [ ] Ensure you select the clinic selections that make up your team and click "Apply" to generate patient-level data in the Viz and Data tabs. 
- [ ] Select clinics that your team refers to in the **"Team Flow Selection"** tab to produce data tracking patients stepped up/down for the **Team (SP) Flow module.**
- **Prior to today's session, __________________ \[Team Lead's name\] worked with us to build an initial team dataset.**  
-  **__________________ [Team Lead's name], which column did we find most helpful for creating this team's dataset?**  
- **Are there any adjustments that the team would make to the clinic selection criteria? For example, should we include trainees? Other considerations that seem important?**

### 3. Click to view the "viz" tabs, which show team trends.  

- [ ] **The Viz tab helps us zoom out and see team trends for diagnoses (Diag), encounters (Enc), health factor data (HF; e.g., suicide plans, evidence-based practice templates), measures (Meas), and behavioral and suicide risks (Flag) from Mental Health Assistant. Click on the respective tabs (Diag, Enc, etc) to view these trends.**

-  [ ] Your team's needs was about ____________. Let's go to the ________ **[fill out tab]** viz tab to see data relevant to that issue.  

<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> ***00:25-00:35***
-  [ ] **What stands out to you about _____________________________ [fill-in team needs]?**  
  
-  [ ] **What is most important to you to check out first related to  ________________________________ [fill-in team needs]?**
    [Prepare in advance, but ask this as an open-ended question.]
  
  -  [ ] **What is most surprising?**  [Prepare in advance, but ask this as an open-ended question.] 
-  [ ] **What viz option would you use to see what the most common service encounters or visits are?**
-  [ ] **Are there services that have been increasing over time?**
-  [ ] **Are there services that have been decreasing over time?**

<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> ***00:35-00:40***

### 4. Click to view the "data" tabs, which show your team's individual patient information.  
-  [ ] **In the data tabs, we can zoom in on specific veterans. Patient information corresponds to the same categories as the team trends: diagnoses (Diag), encounters (Enc), health factor data (HF; e.g., suicide plans, evidence-based practice templates), measures (Meas), and behavioral and suicide risks (Flag) from Mental Health Assistant.**

-  [ ] Providers can filter to find specific patients, or produce reports using the filter panel.
-  [ ] **What data tab would you use to find out how many current patients on the team are engaged in a specific evidence-based psychotherapy?**
-  [ ] **What column shows you the session number (EBP template) that the patient is on?**

(During intersession prep, facilitator should fill-in the rankings of the highest priority viz that should be emphasized during the team meeting. Follow the team's lead "live" during the meeting, but be prepared.)

## With the team trends (viz) and team patient (data) information in your data UI, your team can efficiently use team meetings to focus on the interrelated issues of care coordination and team quality improvement.

That's it for *Modeling to Learn* how to check our patient data and team trends. Next is our Done/Do review. 

### Navigate to the SEE guide to show Done/Do table  
[<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style = “display:inline-block”/>](#DontClick) ____________ **Time 00:50-00:60 - Done/Do**
 
- [ ] [<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/done.png" height = "40" width = "40">](#DontClick) Done: We selected a Team Lead. We selected the clinics that make up our team for the Team Data. 
- [ ] [<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/do.png" height = "40" width = "40">](#DontClick) 
 Review the HF, Diag, Enc and Flag tabs in Team Data to find a patient (zoom in) and find a team trend (zoom out). Log in to mtl.how/data and look at the team data.

**Confirm Team Clinic Selections:**
- [ ] Schedule meeting with Team Lead & make Clinic Selections and Team Flow Selections.
- [ ] Export Clinic Selections and Team Flow Selections from Power BI.
- [ ] Post export file in the shared MS Teams Channel for the team to review and confirm selections.
