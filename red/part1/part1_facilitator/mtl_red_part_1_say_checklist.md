# MTL Red Part I Facilitator Checklist

- [ ]  Hello! I'm __________ and I'm __________. Today we're modeling to learn how to check our patient data and team trends.

- [ ] Navigate to the Learner See Guide for Session 2 to show Done and Do

## Learning Objectives
1. Describe the decisions your team made in producing your team data.
2. Test whether team historical trends shown in the "viz" tabs reflect your expectations.
3. Apply your clinical expertise to identify new information about a team patient in the "data" tabs.

## Participatory Learning from Simulation
- [ ] Graphic: how *MTL* can help us to get more of our Veterans to the right care in the right time to meet their needs using participatory learning from simulation.
- [ ] We use the data user interface (UI) to:
	- look back at team trends over the past two years.
	- review the last two years of data to see *what is* in our team now.
		* Backward looking data review is limited for guiding effective change.
* Reviewing trends: may like or not like the trends; may not know what is causing those trends; may be afraid that the next change we might make will undo it. 
- [ ] Review use of sim UI – to look at team trends 2 years into the future to answer *what if* questions about different decisions the team could make.

- [ ] Confirm who will "drive" today [Recommend the Team Lead]

### 1. On any browser, navigate to mtl.how/data_test.
- [ ] Explain the MTL data user interface Power BI site:
	- You must have your PIV engaged to access the site.
	- Note: If you are getting a red row-level security (RLS) error on the homepage, please let us know and we can grant you access.
- *Reminder:* Power BI site contains Protected Health Information (PHI) - access is according to the permissions that are set up on your PIV.  
- We'll show you how to pull and view data here. It will be stored and saved back to the secure site, so that you can protect patient PHI just as you do in all your work.

- In the left-hand navigation pane, select the appropriate consortium and VISN tabs.
- Click on the 'Clinic Selections' tab.

### See SAY guide for narration details on making Clinic Selections for Team (SP) Flow module 

### 2. Select and View Your Local Team Data 

- [ ] **Think through your Clinic Selection criteria carefully (e.g. Should you include trainees? De-activated clinics? Clinical Resource Hub providers?).**

- [ ] In the "Clinic Selections" tab, select the Division **______________**
- [ ] Select the Clinics **_________________**  
- [ ] Ensure you select the clinic selections that make up your team and click "Apply" to generate patient-level data in the Viz and Data tabs.

- **Prior to today's session, __________________ \[Team Lead's name\] worked with us to build an initial team dataset.**  
-  **__________________ [Team Lead's name], which column did we find most helpful for creating this team's dataset?**  
- **Are there any adjustments that the team would make to the clinic selection criteria? For example, should we include trainees? Other considerations that seem important?**

### 3. Click to view the "viz" tabs, which show team trends.  

- [ ] **The Viz tab helps us zoom out and see team trends for diagnoses (Diag), encounters (Enc), health factor data (HF; e.g., suicide plans, evidence-based practice templates), measures (Meas), and behavioral and suicide risks (Flag) from Mental Health Assistant. Click on the respective tabs (Diag, Enc, etc) to view these trends.**

-  [ ] Your team's vision was about ____________. Let's go to the ________ **[fill out tab]** viz tab to see data relevant to that issue.  

<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> ***00:25-00:35***
-  [ ] **What stands out to you about _____________________________ [fill-in team vision]?**  
  
-  [ ] **What is most important to you to check out first related to  ________________________________ [fill-in team vision]?**
    [Prepare in advance, but ask this as an open-ended question.]
  
  -  [ ] **What is most surprising?**  [Prepare in advance, but ask this as an open-ended question.] 
-  [ ] **What viz option would you use to see what the most common service encounters or visits are?**
-  [ ] **Are there services that have been increasing over time?**
-  [ ] **Are there services that have been decreasing over time?**

<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> ***00:35-00:40***

### 4. Click to view the "data" tabs, which show your team's individual patient information.  
-  [ ] **In the data tabs, we can zoom in on specific veterans. Patient information corresponds to the same categories as the team trends: diagnoses (Diag), encounters (Enc), health factor data (HF; e.g., suicide plans, evidence-based practice templates), measures (Meas), and behavioral and suicide risks (Flag) from Mental Health Assistant.**

-  [ ] Providers can filter to find specific patients, or produce reports using the filter panel.
-  [ ] **What data tab would you use to find out how many current patients on the team are engaged in a specific evidence-based psychotherapy?**
-  [ ]**What column shows you the session number (EBP template) that the patient is on?**

(During intersession prep, facilitator should fill-in the rankings of the highest priority viz that should be emphasized during the team meeting. Follow the team's lead "live" during the meeting, but be prepared.)
Time Stamp | Team Learning Priorities | Script

**Prioritize which questions you will use given this team's guiding vision.** |  |  |

## With the team trends (viz) and team patient (data) information in your data UI, your team can efficiently use team meetings to focus on the interrelated issues of care coordination and team quality improvement.

### That's it for *Modeling to Learn* how to check our patient data and team trends. Next is our Done/Do review.

After the Session:
- [ ] Schedule Meeting with Team Lead & Make Clinic Selections 
- [ ] Export Clinic Selections from Power BI (See Red Part I Say Guide for Instructions)
- [ ] Post Export file in the shared MS Teams Channel for the team to review and confirm selections
