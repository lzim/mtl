### Background
The *Modeling to Learn* simulation user-interface (sim UI) is used in *Modeling to Learn Blue* Sessions 5-10 to run simulation experiments of the frontline team's operations and coordination. Co-facilitators help each team select one of 5 simulation modules during Sessions 1-4 based on the team's vision, needs and priorities. 

The 5 modules are Care Coordination, Medication Management, Psychotherapy, Aggregate Mix of Services, and Measurement Based Care and Suicide Prevention. Each team runs 4 simulation experiments in their selected module: their basecase of no new decisions; experiment 1 testing the team's first hypothesis for addressing their priority need; experiment 2 testing their second hypothesis; and experiment 3, combining multiple new decisions the team could implement.

### [Simulation User-Interface (mtl.how/sim)](https://mtl.how/sim)
Using their VA email, clinicians can login to one of two types of environments, or "worlds", in the sim UI: the Team world or the Individual world. The team world allows access to all team members so they can combine their thinking and run experiments together. The individual world is a unique environment where each team member can run experiments on their own and explore beyond the collective work of the team. Co-facilitators can "map" themselves to team and individual worlds in various ways for different purposes, as described further under Forio Epicenter backend management.

The sim UI includes the following navigation icons & features:

**Icons**
- Team: Click on this to chat with your team or co-facilitator live during the session
- More Info: Click on this to read more info about the different modules and functions of the simulation user-interface
- News: Click on this to quickly read the current news flashes on Community of Practice discussion items. This icon includes a red notification button alerting you to the number of unread messages, similar to the notification system on your phone!
- Report Bug: Click on this to report any issues, including the option to include screenshots. No PII/PHI please!
- Tutor: Click on this icon for an "over the shoulder" walk through of the different icons, headers, and functions across the simulation user-interface with navigation buttons. These pop-ups also include links to the TMS video and relevant session guide further detailing the section.
- Community: Click on this floating button to contribute ideas, like something, or ask a question on the online Community of Practice. You can also further search the Community of Practice for previously answered questions or to get involved in any discussions. No PII/PHI here please!

**Features**
- Quick Tips: Anytime you're waiting for a new screen to load, a quick tip and related icon will pop-up to remind you of different functions.
- Alerts: If we need to alert users of any urgent or sensitive news, a pop-up will flash once logged in with details.

### [Forio Epicenter Admin (mtl.how/facilitate)](https://mtl.how/facilitate)
All co-facilitators and HQ support team members will create an Epicenter login and be added to the TeamPSD project on Epicenter. From here, co-facilitators will be able to see and have access to the Development (Dev), Test, and Production (Prod) environments of all TeamPSD tools hosted on Epicenter (mtl.how/sim, mtl.how/team, and mtl.how/demo). This platform also gives access to the underlying model files that run the simulation user-interface. However, these **are not to be changed or accessed by anyone, except the model workgroup**.

**Dev** – This instance is for the exclusive use of the Development Team (A.K.A. “DEV”). Dev develops each sprint in this instance until they are satisfied it is ready for user testing. When iterations are completed, the sprint is promoted to PROD.

**Test** – This instance is for the Workgroup Leads and others to conduct user testing of the current sprint. When the testing and resulting development iterations are completed, the sprint is promoted to PROD.

**Prod** – This is the Production instance that is available for the *Modeling to Learn* learners to use.
(include explanation of dev, test, prod) - The underlying model files responsible for running the simulation user-interface 

Through the Epicenter backend platform, users can:
- Manage team data files
- Manage permissions and add new end users
- Add new learners and facilitators
- Manage, create, and troubleshoot team groups, worlds, and roles 


By changing roles to a facilitator instead of a learner, users can also access the Facilitator Dashboard which includes:
- Dashboards: Click here to see a quick overview on progress of each experiment for the team, team roster, and statistics on each team experiment (i.e. time taken, attendance, etc.)
- Community (THIS SAYS PLDR CAN WE CHANGE): Click here to see which users have contributed to the Community of Practice as well as the corresponding issue number for GitHub. Users can also manage text for the Community button, News, and Alerts. 
- Chat: Click here to chat back with the team during a live session
- More Info: Click here to add or edit text displayed in the More Info section of the sim UI.
- Tutor: Click here to add or edit text & links displayed in the Tutor pop-ups.
- Tips: Click here to add or edit text & icons displayed in the Quick Tips pop-ups.
