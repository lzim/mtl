# MTL Live Session 10

## Today we're modeling to learn how to use systems thinking.

Hello! I'm \________________ (facilitator's name) and I'm \_______________ (co-facilitator's name). Today we're modeling to learn how to use systems thinking.

**As you can see in the Done/Do table in the Learner See Guide:**

## Learning Objectives

1. Describe the decisions you experimented with and how they are intertwined with other decisions and clinic outcomes over time.
2. Test your understanding of the causal system story by describing what’s happening when it produces a system behavior over time.
3. Apply your thinking to anticipate the short and long term trends in your team’s care quality under different decision scenarios.

## Let's get started!

## In-session Exercise (30 minutes)

**We've been _Modeling to Learn_ how to improve our use of systems thinking when making care decisions in our team.**

Systems Thinking | Definition
-- | --
Complex | **Forest not trees.**  Relationships among two or more variables (wait times, improvement rate), or two or more settings (primary care, general mental health).
Feedback | **Loop not line.**  Not simple cause and effect. The end of the story often influences the beginning, and is strengthened (reinforcing) or reduced (balancing) around the loop.
System Behavior | **Movie not snapshot.**  Trends over time. Systems cause their own behavior through feedback.
Time | **Short and long term.**  Better understanding of change over time (e.g., worse before better, better before worse).

**We'll work to apply these skills as we review our combined experiment 3 today.**

### 1. Log in to mtl.how/sim and join the current session.

### 2. From the experiment section, pull up the prior experiment and click the red "Go" button.

### 3. Check the box to include the text from that experiment and click "Go" again.

### 4. Note that the sliders have moved to the settings for that experiment.

- The experiment sliders automatically adjust to the prior experiment we just selected.

### 5. Open the Outputs and Text section and select another earlier experiment to compare to the one you have just pulled up.

- Select the two previous experiments, base case from Session 7 and experiment 1 from Session 8, to compare.

### 6. Note the variables that were manipulated in the two experiments.

### 7. Review the findings from the two experiments in the results dashboard and the text entered for Hypothesis, Findings and Decisions.

### 8. Collapse the Outputs and Text section and move it to the side to reveal the causal system model diagram.

### 9. Use the diagram to tell a causal systems story about the differences in the two experiments.

[<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_question.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/>](#.) **Our Question.** *Briefly describe what your team wants to learn from this experiment.*

### 10. Consider running a combination experiment that incorporates the sliders manipulated in both experiments.

- Consider running a combination experiment that incorporates the sliders manipulated in both experiments. Enter your Question for this experiment in the Text box.

[<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_hypothesis.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/>](#.) **Our Hypothesis.** *Outline the systems story your team believes will cause the outcomes your team expects to observe.*

### 11. Replace text in the Q/H/F/D boxes to reflect the team's hypotheses and expectations for the combined experiment.

- Use the model diagram to develop a **Dynamic Hypothesis** about the expected system behaviors that the combined decisions in Experiment 3 will produce. Enter your Hypothesis and delete prior Findings and Decisions.
- Ask, “What do you think the effects will be of these changes?  How much better will things get?”  Push the team to be as specific as possible, both with their change and the result.

### 12. Save, name, and run the combined experiment.

- Move the text to the left to adjust the experiment sliders to reflect the desired Experiment 3, then save, name, and run the experiment.

### 13. Discuss and record results and decisions, including your thinking about long-term trends in your clinic's EBP reach under various decision scenarios.

- In the Results Dashboard, review how causal feedback explains why the decisions in experiment 3 combine to produce the relative differences in specific variables and values over time. Enter your Findings about causal relationships that explain the differences in short- and long-term trends between the base case, experiment 1, experiment 2, and experiment 3. Document decisions the team will consider implementing in the clinic.
- _Model systems thinking for the team by highlighting the C.F.B.T. systems thinking concepts that are included in the q/h/f/d text boxes._
- _Note the **dominant causal feedback that produces the system behaviors,** and note the **highest leverage (high yield) decisions** that are most **clinically feasible** for the team to implement in their care._

## That's it for _Modeling to Learn_ how to use systems thinking. Next is our Done/Do review.
