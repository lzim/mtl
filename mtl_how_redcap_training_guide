## Training Objectives:
By the end of this training, learners will be able to:
1. Create a new project with appropriate titles, purpose, and template
2. Understand the different types of user roles and their privileges
3. Create REDCap accounts for new users
4. Use survey queue for creating a logic where all users can use a single link but still get to their individual survey

### General Overview
1. What is REDCap?
- REDCap or Research Electronic Data Capture, is a secure web application for building and managing online surveys and databases. REDCap was originally created by a small team at Vanderbilt, and has since expanded across thousands of non-profit and government organizations. Each system is independently maintained and supported - we specifically are using the VA REDCap. You can check out FAQ's, videos, etc. at the main REDCap website [here](https://www.project-redcap.org/).

2. When does TeamPSD use REDCAP? 
- We use it in the _Modeling to Learn_ program at Session 4 for the _Modeling to Learn_ Menu (mtl.how/menu) that assesses team needs and priorities to pick an _MTL_ module to use starting Session 5
- Research surveys from measures in the grants that are taken at baseline and 6 months. Remember, these surveys are **voluntary and can be stopped at any time**.

#### Learning Check:
1. What are TeamPSD's varying uses of REDCap? How do they align against timelines with the _Modeling to Learn_ 12 session plan? 
2. What audience is each use geared towards?

### Overview of REDCap
This [overview video of REDCap](https://redcap.vanderbilt.edu/consortium/videoplayer.php?video=redcap_overview03.mp4&title=Detailed+Overview+of+REDCap+%2814+min%29&text=This+14-minute+video+provides+a+thorough+overview+of+REDCap+and+much+of+its+functionality.+%0A%09%09%09%09%09%09%09%09%09This+video+is+an+excellent+place+to+begin+learning+about+REDCap+and+what+it+is+capable+of.&referer=REDCAP_PUBLIC) video includes how to create new projects in REDCap and how to edit records.

#### Learning Check:
1. Our team will not typically fill in survey records for our participants. Based on what we learned about our TeamPSD's survey uses, why might this be the case?
2. While we typically wouldn't enter/edit records, in what situation might an HQ member enter data in a record *instead* of the learner?
3. A learner has a question about their survey data, where do you go to check or edit their record?
4. Can you create more than one instrument in the same project? If so, how?
5. How do you add new users to a project? (More detailed distinctions between the user rights and roles is covered further down in the this training). 
6. Where do you go to view records? What types of data views can you access here? How do you export data?
7. (Note: **DO NOT** put your fake project in production.) Once you put your project in production, how do you make changes?

### How to Create and Work with Instruments
This [introduction to instrument development](https://redcap.vanderbilt.edu/consortium/videoplayer.php?video=intro_instrument_dev.mp4&title=Introduction+to+Instrument+Development+%286+min%29&text=&referer=REDCAP_PUBLIC) and [online instrument designer view](https://redcap.vanderbilt.edu/consortium/videoplayer.php?video=online_designer01.flv&title=The+Online+Designer+%285+min%29&text=&referer=REDCAP_PUBLIC) details how to use "instruments" in REDCap.

#### Learning Check:
1. Where do you click to build **new** instruments? Where do you click to view **existing** instruments?
2. How do you move, add, and edit instrument fields in the online designer (what buttons do you click or clicking do you do)?
3. Where do you go to view the status of each record? What do each of the colors mean on this dashboard?
4. What is another way you can update instruments fields?
5. Where do you go to view the mode of the project (development, production, etc.)?
6. (Go to second video)
7. How do you enable/disable, rename, or delete surveys?
8. What are the five buttons on each field instrument and what are their functions?
9. **STOP** at timestamp 5:00 minutes on the second video.
10. ***Within*** a survey instrument, click on "Survey Settings." What customization options do you see here and where can we apply our TeamPSD style here?

### Managing Design, Automation, and Participant Management
Follow [this PDF](https://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/crc/workshop_files/2014-09-19.pdf) through for a walkthrough of different customization options for designing and queuing instruments, managing invitations and participants.

#### Learning Check:
1. **SKIP** the "Design Options, Notifications, Automated Invitations" section.
2. How will we use the survey queuing function with our _Modeling to Learn_ teams and why is it important? What can happen if we get this logic incorrect?
3. On the "Public Survey Link" page, where can you find the link to the survey? Since we use co-branded links, what is the next step to ensure that the co-branded link goes to the correct page?
4. Why might we want to use the login or access code function?
 
### User Rights & Roles
Review [this PDF](https://cri.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/REDCap-User-Rights-Best-Practices.pdf) that outlines the rights and abilities for different types of access by role to help make decisions on what roles team members should be assigned.

#### Learning Check:
1. What are the groups of team members that will need access to VA REDCap? How will they interact with the platform and what user roles will be most appropriate?

#### OVERALL Learning Check:
1. Define each of the words below and what vocabulary they map to in our _Modeling to Learn_ or TeamPSD language (i.e. Users in REDCap = HQ or Team Members in TeamPSD):
- Users
- Projects
- Instruments
- Participants
- Queue
- Records


#### Common Mistakes:

1. If you're clicking through any of the surveys to test them, make sure to delete your records afterwards so it does not affect our data reports and analysis. 

2. Are you or someone unable to see specific menu options that they typically expect to see? Check the user roles.
